# CNCF AI Conformance

## Overview

This directory contains evidence for [CNCF Kubernetes AI Conformance](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance)
certification. Each submission certifies a specific product on a specific Kubernetes
distribution, with evidence collected using AICR as the validation tooling.

> **Note:** It is the **product deployed on a Kubernetes platform** that is conformant.
> AICR serves as the deployment and validation tooling (similar to sonobuoy for K8s
> conformance), while the certified product is the AI inference/training platform.

## Submissions

| Version | Product | Platform | Status | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| v1.35 | [NVIDIA NIM](https://developer.nvidia.com/nim) | EKS | 9/9 PASS | [v1.35/nim-eks/](v1.35/nim-eks/) |

## Usage

Evidence collection has two steps:

### Structural Validation (CI)

`aicr validate` checks component health, CRDs, and constraints for CI:

```bash
# Structural validation + evidence rendering
aicr validate -r recipe.yaml \
  --phase conformance --evidence-dir ./evidence
```

### CNCF Submission Evidence

Add `--cncf-submission` to collect detailed behavioral evidence for CNCF AI
Conformance submission. This deploys GPU workloads, captures command outputs,
workload logs, nvidia-smi output, and Prometheus queries:

```bash
# Collect all behavioral evidence
aicr validate --phase conformance \
  --evidence-dir ./evidence --cncf-submission

# Collect specific features
aicr validate --phase conformance \
  --evidence-dir ./evidence --cncf-submission -f dra -f hpa
```

Alternatively, run the evidence collection script directly. Valid section
names are `dra`, `gang`, `secure`, `accelerator-metrics`, `service-metrics`,
`gateway`, `operator`, `hpa`, `cluster-autoscaling`, or `all`:

```bash
./pkg/evidence/cncf/scripts/collect-evidence.sh all
./pkg/evidence/cncf/scripts/collect-evidence.sh dra
```

> **Note:** The `--cncf-submission` flag deploys GPU workloads and takes ~5-10
> minutes. The evidence collection script automatically detects the AI workload
> type (NIM inference, Dynamo inference, or Kubeflow training) and collects
> appropriate metrics and operator evidence.

Each section writes exactly one **PASS**, **SKIP**, or **FAIL** verdict.
**SKIP** marks an absent optional prerequisite (no inference gateway, no
supported operator, an unsupported cluster-autoscaling provider, or an
operator present with no workload to reconcile) and is not a failure. A
**FAIL** — an unhealthy present capability, a failed query, or a missing/
malformed verdict — fails closed and makes the collection exit non-zero, so a
recorded section failure is no longer masked as overall success.

### Two Modes

| | `aicr validate --phase conformance` | `--cncf-submission` |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | CI pass/fail | CNCF submission evidence |
| **Speed** | ~3 minutes | ~5-10 minutes |
| **Deploys workloads** | Yes (GPU allocation via DRA or device plugin, gang, HPA, secure access) | Yes (all + GPU stress test) |
| **Output** | Pass/fail + diagnostic artifacts | Detailed behavioral evidence (command outputs, logs, metrics) |
| **GPU allocation test** | secure-accelerator-access deploys a test pod via DRA or the device plugin (capability-driven) and verifies GPU access + isolation; dra-support's full-GPU DRA behavioral subtest is recorded N/A on ComputeDomain-only clusters | Mode-aware evidence script (recipe policy selects the mode, standalone runs detect capability): behavioral full-GPU ResourceClaim test under DRA, device-plugin two-container isolation test + ResourceSlice evidence otherwise; nvidia-smi output capture |
| **Gang scheduling test** | Deploys PodGroup, verifies co-scheduling | Two-phase all-or-nothing test on one pinned GPU node: a blocker leaves exactly one GPU free — neither worker may be **bound** (`spec.nodeName`, not pod phase) during the barrier window — then the blocker is removed and both workers must complete together; worker logs captured. Requires a **fully idle, Ready, schedulable GPU node with ≥ 2 allocatable GPUs**. Barrier credit requires the scheduler's AFFIRMATIVE gang decision, both parts verified live: each worker shows `PodScheduled=False/Unschedulable` AND the named PodGroup's scheduling status carries KAI's one-of-two gang refusal ("Resources were found for 1 pods while 2 are required for gang scheduling") — so merely-unbound pods (down/restarting/backlogged scheduler) and generically-refused pods (queue quota, transient fit errors) are never credited. Pods associate to the PodGroup via the `pod-group-name` annotation (the `pod-group.scheduling.run.ai/*` labels alone do NOT associate — KAI's pod-grouper ignores them and creates per-pod groups) |
| **HPA autoscaling** | Metrics API + scale-up validation | CUDA GPU stress test + scale-up |
| **Metrics** | Custom metrics API data-path verification | DCGM exporter + Prometheus queries |
| **Gateway** | Condition verification (Accepted, Programmed) | Same |
| **Webhook test** | Rejection test with invalid CR | Schema-valid but webhook-invalid CR per operator, submitted with server-side dry-run (nothing persists); PASS requires a denial naming the operator's own webhook entry — CRD-schema rejections (`Required value`) and denials from other admission webhooks (e.g. a cluster policy webhook) are explicitly classified as NOT demonstrating the operator's webhook and FAIL |
| **Cluster autoscaling** | Cloud node group validation | Cloud-provider autoscaler API |
