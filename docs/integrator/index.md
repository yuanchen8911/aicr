# Integrator Documentation

Documentation for engineers integrating AI Cluster Runtime (AICR) into CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, or larger platforms.

## Audience

This section is for integrators who:
- Build automation pipelines using the AICR API
- Deploy and operate the AICR API server in Kubernetes
- Create custom recipes for their environments
- Integrate AICR into GitOps workflows (Argo CD, Flux)

## Quick Start

### API Server Deployment

See [Kubernetes Deployment](kubernetes-deployment.md) for full manifests. After deployment:

```shell
# Generate recipe via API
curl "http://aicrd.aicr.svc/v1/recipe?service=eks&accelerator=h100"
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Generate recipe
  run: |
    curl -s "http://aicrd.aicr.svc/v1/recipe?service=eks&accelerator=h100" \
      -o recipe.json

- name: Generate bundles
  # recipe.json is the fully-hydrated RecipeResult from the GET above; the
  # bundle endpoint adopts it as-is and bundles all of its componentRefs.
  # To bundle a subset, add the `bundlers` query parameter (comma-delimited
  # component names, e.g. "?bundlers=gpu-operator,network-operator") rather
  # than hand-trimming componentRefs, which drops required dependencies.
  # Unknown or disabled component names are rejected with HTTP 400.
  run: |
    curl -X POST "http://aicrd.aicr.svc/v1/bundle" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d @recipe.json \
      -o bundles.zip
```
