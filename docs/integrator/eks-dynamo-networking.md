# EKS Dynamo Networking Prerequisites

For `*-eks-ubuntu-inference-dynamo` recipes, AICR configures
`dynamo-platform` with Kubernetes-native discovery. As of the Dynamo 1.4+
bump, AICR no longer installs bundled NATS by default: the request plane
defaults to TCP and the KV event plane defaults to ZMQ
(`ai-dynamo/dynamo#11951`). This removes the old `4222` NATS requirement,
but it does **not** remove the underlying cross-nodegroup networking
requirement — the request plane and KV events are now **direct
frontend↔worker pod-to-pod connections** instead of both sides talking to a
`dynamo-platform-nats` StatefulSet on the system nodegroup, and Frontend
pods still run on the system nodegroup while workers run on the GPU
nodegroup, so traffic still crosses the same GPU↔system nodegroup SG
boundary as before.

**Confirmed on a live Dynamo 1.4.1 EKS deployment (`aicr-gb300`, 2026-09-01).**
The 1.4.2 chart pins the same `grove`/`kai-scheduler` dependency versions as
1.4.1, so this is not expected to change in 1.4.2, but it has not been
re-verified live against 1.4.2:
the frontend does not listen on a request-plane or KV-event port at all — its
only listener is its own HTTP API (`8000`). The connections that cross the
GPU↔system nodegroup boundary are the **frontend connecting out to the
worker**, not the other way around:

- **ZMQ KV-event plane** — fixed per worker via `--kv-events-config`, e.g.
  `{"enable_kv_cache_events":true,"publisher":"zmq","endpoint":"tcp://*:5557"}`
  (see `tests/manifests/dynamo-vllm-smoke-test.yaml`), offset by `+dp_rank`
  for dp_rank > 0. The worker binds this; the frontend connects to it.
- **TCP request plane** — the worker's runtime logs
  `Initializing NetworkManager with TCP request plane` (`mode=tcp`,
  `port=OS-assigned`) on startup: this is an **OS-assigned ephemeral port**,
  not a fixed one like NATS's `4222`. It varies per pod and cannot be
  allowlisted as a single port number.

If the GPU and system node groups sit in different security groups, these
ports may be blocked from GPU nodes to the frontend's node (and vice versa).
Typical symptoms:
- Dynamo frontend and vLLM worker pods stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`, or a
  frontend that starts cleanly but never successfully routes a request
  through to a worker
- Worker startup probes failing with `connection refused` because the
  process exits before serving
- The `inference-perf` performance validator failing after its
  workload-readiness (10 min) and health (5 min) gates lapse — roughly
  15 min — while `deployment` and `conformance` pass; the workload never
  reaches a ready state

You can confirm reachability directly from a system-nodegroup node before
re-running — this is the direction that matters, since the frontend (system
nodegroup) is what initiates the connection to the worker (GPU nodegroup):

```shell
kubectl run tcp-probe --rm -i --restart=Never --image=busybox:1.36 \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"<system-node-label-key>":"<value>"}}}' \
  -- sh -c 'nc -zv -w 5 <worker-pod-ip-or-svc> 5557'
```

The conformance validator's `ai-service-metrics` check adds a third requirement:
it dials Prometheus over the cluster Service (typically
`kube-prometheus-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090`). The orchestrator Job that
runs the check tolerates every taint and now sets a *preferred*
`dependencyAffinity` toward Prometheus, so the scheduler co-locates it with the
Prometheus pod when possible. The preference is best-effort, not required, so it
can still fall back to any worker node (e.g. if the Prometheus node is
unschedulable) — including one whose ENI is in a security group that cannot
reach the Prometheus pod.

When that happens, the dial times out at 5 s and the check is marked `failed`:

```text
[SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE] Prometheus unreachable at http://kube-prometheus-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090 — verify network connectivity
```

On a fallback placement the outcome can be **non-deterministic from run to
run**: scheduling tie-breaks and image-locality scoring decide which node wins,
so a re-run on a "freshly working" cluster is not a reliable signal that the SG
topology is correct.

The preferred `dependencyAffinity` ([issue #933](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/933),
resolved) makes this far less likely, but because it is best-effort the `9090`
SG rule below remains the reliable cluster-side guarantee.

## Required Security Group Rules

Allow ingress from the **system node security group to the GPU node security
group** — the frontend (system nodegroup) initiates both connections; the
worker (GPU nodegroup) is the listener:
- TCP `5557` (+`dp_rank` per worker) - ZMQ KV-cache event plane
- The ephemeral port range (worker's OS-assigned request-plane port) —
  Dynamo does not expose a way to pin this to a fixed port, so the rule must
  cover the node's local ephemeral range (Linux default
  `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`, typically `32768-60999`; verify the actual
  range on the AMI in use) rather than a single port number

Separately, allow ingress from the GPU node security group to the system node
security group on:
- TCP `9090` - Prometheus (required for the `ai-service-metrics` conformance check)

The `9090` rule is required as a fallback guarantee: the orchestrator *prefers*
to co-locate with Prometheus, but that preference is best-effort, so it can
still land on any worker node. Every node group whose pods can host the
orchestrator must therefore be able to reach the Prometheus pod's IP on `9090`.
On clusters with separate customer/system ENI subnets (e.g. DGXC EKS), this
means the system SG must accept ingress from the customer SG (and any other
worker SG), not only from itself.

If the cluster has more than two worker security groups (e.g. a separate
inference node group), repeat the `9090` rule for each non-system SG that can
host pods — on a fallback placement the orchestrator may land on any of them.

Example:

```shell
# 1) Find SG IDs for system and GPU nodegroups
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:eks:nodegroup-name,Values=<system-nodegroup>" \
  --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId" \
  --output text

aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:eks:nodegroup-name,Values=<gpu-nodegroup>" \
  --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId" \
  --output text

# 2) Allow the frontend (system SG) to reach the worker's ZMQ KV-event port
#    and OS-assigned request-plane port on the GPU SG
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <gpu-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp --port 5557 --source-group <system-sg-id>

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <gpu-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp --port 32768-60999 --source-group <system-sg-id>

# 3) Allow Prometheus from GPU SG -> system SG (fallback placement guarantee)
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <system-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp --port 9090 --source-group <gpu-sg-id>
```
