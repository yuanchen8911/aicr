# RKE2 VR200 Setup

Bare-metal setup guide for the four Preview coordinates AICR publishes on VR200
(Vera Rubin) NVL72 hardware running RKE2:

- [`rke2/vr200-ubuntu/training`](https://validation.aicr.run/#/rke2/vr200-ubuntu/training)
- [`rke2/vr200-ubuntu/training-kubeflow`](https://validation.aicr.run/#/rke2/vr200-ubuntu/training-kubeflow) — adds Kubeflow Trainer to
  the training leaf
- [`rke2/vr200-ubuntu/inference`](https://validation.aicr.run/#/rke2/vr200-ubuntu/inference) — platform-neutral inference base (resolves when `--platform` is omitted)
- [`rke2/vr200-ubuntu/inference-dynamo`](https://validation.aicr.run/#/rke2/vr200-ubuntu/inference-dynamo)

> **`service=rke2` and `accelerator=vr200` are Preview.** They publish an early-adopter recipe path without the full production support and lifecycle qualification required for Supported status. Published validation evidence exists for all four coordinates at [validation.aicr.run](https://validation.aicr.run/); freshness against the current recipe is captured in the **Evidence status** note below.

**Evidence status.** The recipes for the three original coordinates have
changed since evidence publication (`aicr evidence digest` reports a mismatch
against each pointer's `predicate.recipe.digest`); treat that linked evidence
as historical precedent for the recipe content at publication time, not as
validating the current recipe. The `training-kubeflow` evidence is current — it
was published from a three-phase run against the recipe as it ships today.

**Which prerequisites apply where.** The node-level requirements — Ubuntu 26.04
with the 64k-page kernel, the Skyhook-driven kernel-cmdline reboots, and the
host `nvidia-imex` masking — apply to **all four** coordinates. The Kubeflow
leaf inherits them from `vr200-rke2-ubuntu-training`.

The two families do **not** otherwise share a chain: training resolves through
`vr200-rke2-ubuntu-training -> rke2-training -> rke2`, inference through
`rke2-inference -> rke2`. Requirements that follow from the inference chain —
the `< 1.36.0` Kubernetes cap and the Gateway API / LoadBalancer prerequisites
— are inference-only and are marked as such where they appear below.

## Cluster Prerequisites

- **Bare-metal RKE2.** These recipes target physical VR200 NVL72 racks; there
  is no cloud-managed RKE2 lane in scope for v1. Node lifecycle (reimage,
  reboot recovery, BMC intervention) is the operator's responsibility — plan
  BMC access before rollout because the Skyhook-driven kernel-cmdline changes
  described below reboot each GPU node.
- **Kubernetes version window.** The training leaves (plain and Kubeflow) pin
  `K8s.server.version >= 1.34.1` because ComputeDomain / IMEX for the NVL72
  MNNVL fabric uses the GA DRA API (`resource.k8s.io/v1`), and the RKE2 root's
  CDI/NRI containerd 2.1 lands at `v1.34.1+rke2r1`. **Both** inference
  leaves (`vr200-rke2-ubuntu-inference` and `vr200-rke2-ubuntu-inference-dynamo`)
  additionally **cap** the window at `< 1.36.0` — the cap is authored on the
  `rke2-inference` base, restated on the VR200 inference base, and inherited
  by the Dynamo child. RKE2 v1.36 changes the default packaged ingress to
  Traefik, whose bundled `rke2-traefik-crd` release would collide with the
  Gateway API CRDs `rke2-inference` installs itself.
- **Ubuntu 26.04 with the Vera-optimized arm64 64k-page kernel.** The
  `os-ubuntu` mixin is deliberately not used — it pins Ubuntu 24.04, while the
  VR200 NVL72 reference image ships Ubuntu 26.04 with
  `7.0.0-*-nvidia-bos-64k`.
- **StorageClass.** RKE2 ships no default StorageClass (unlike k3s, which
  bundles `local-path-provisioner`). None of the four recipes needs one:
  as of Dynamo 1.4, `dynamo-platform` no longer installs the bundled NATS
  JetStream StatefulSet whose PVC previously required a StorageClass. If you
  opt back into bundled NATS, install any dynamic provisioner and mark it
  default before deploying the `inference-dynamo` bundle.
- **LoadBalancer (inference chain only).** RKE2 provisions no LoadBalancer
  controller, and the `inference-gateway` Service the `rke2-inference` base
  installs is `type: LoadBalancer`. Install a bare-metal LB implementation
  (e.g. MetalLB or kube-vip) before deploying the `inference` or
  `inference-dynamo` bundle. Without one the Service sits at
  `EXTERNAL-IP <pending>` and the chain's conformance check gates on
  `Gateway.status.conditions[?type=='Programmed'].status == 'True'` — it
  will not go green. (Until an LB exists the gateway is still reachable via
  its NodePort / ClusterIP for smoke tests.)
- **Mask the host `nvidia-imex` service on every GPU node.** The Vera Rubin
  reference image installs the host-managed 615 driver stack, which enables
  an `nvidia-imex` systemd service by default. All four shipped coordinates
  install the DRA `ComputeDomain` daemon unconditionally, which starts its
  own `nvidia-imex` and cannot allocate the session while the host service
  owns it (`NV_ERR_IN_USE`). The consequence is silent: the ComputeDomain
  daemon never goes `Ready`, `ComputeDomain` workloads hang on
  `NodePrepareResources`, and no validator surfaces this. Disable *and* mask
  on every GPU node **before** deploying the bundle (a disable-only lets
  systemd reactivate the service on any dependency pull-in or package
  upgrade, reproducing `NV_ERR_IN_USE`):

  ```shell
  systemctl disable --now nvidia-imex.service
  systemctl mask nvidia-imex.service
  ```

  To fully reverse (unmask alone leaves the service inactive because it was
  also disabled and stopped above):

  ```shell
  systemctl unmask nvidia-imex.service
  systemctl enable --now nvidia-imex.service
  ```

## Rollout Behavior

**All four VR200 coordinates reboot every GPU node they touch.** One
Skyhook CR (`tuning`, from `nodewright-customizations`) ships in each leaf and
carries two rebooting packages:

- `nvidia-tuned` — writes the native `vr200/rke2` `nvidia-tuned` profile to
  `/etc/default/grub.d`; the specific profile is intent-dependent, so
  `tuned-adm active` reports different profiles on different leaves:
  - Training (`vr200-rke2-ubuntu-training`) applies `multiNodeTraining`,
    whose `[bootloader]` stanza adds IOMMU passthrough,
    `init_on_alloc=0`, NUMA balancing off, hugepages, and earlycon.
  - Inference and inference-dynamo (`vr200-rke2-ubuntu-inference*`) apply
    VR200's `inference` profile, whose `[bootloader]` stanza differs.

  In both cases the kernel cmdline is written at config time and nothing is
  live until the reboot. `post-interrupt-bootloader-check` then asserts
  every argument in whichever profile is active reached `/proc/cmdline`
  before the node is labelled tuned.
- `rdma-netns-exclusive` — flips `ib_core netns_mode=0` on every selected
  GPU node. This is a **host-wide, module-level** kernel parameter
  change: it affects every RDMA user on the node, not just this recipe's
  pods. The downstream benefit AICR relies on is that `dranet` can then
  present each pod with only its allocated HCA
  (`/sys/class/infiniband`), but any pre-existing RDMA workload on the
  node — MPI jobs, RDMA-backed storage, other operators — sees the same
  netns-mode change and must tolerate it. **Coordinate with existing RDMA
  users before rollout**, especially on shared reference clusters. Like
  `nvidia-tuned`, this is a kernel-module parameter change that requires
  a reboot to take effect. Enabled by `nodewright-customizations`
  `rdmaNetnsExclusive: true`, independent of `tuningEnabled`.

Because both packages ride one CR, its `interruptionBudget.count: 1`
bounds every reboot the recipe causes: one GPU node at a time. Neither
package depends on the other, so nodewright runs them in the same pass and
coalesces their reboots — **each GPU node reboots once**, and the rack
converges in roughly **N × (reboot time)**. Separate CRs could not give
either guarantee, because an `interruptionBudget` does not compose across
CRs ([#2572](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/2572)).

**Practical implications:**

- `count: 1` sizing suits the small NVL72 clusters VR200 Preview targets
  and gradual rollout onto a cluster already running work; it does not
  scale to hundreds of nodes.
- The CR is `runtimeRequired`, so each node keeps the runtime-required
  taint until **both** packages finish on it — workloads never land on a
  node still in shared RDMA mode.
- On bare metal with no auto-reimage, BMC access must be ready before
  rollout — a reboot that hangs at BIOS is on you to recover.
- **This is not a drive-by deploy.** On any cluster with running workloads,
  apply the bundle deliberately rather than letting it roll unattended.

**Upgrading from a bundle with a separate `rdma-netns-exclusive`
component.** Earlier bundles shipped the RDMA mode as its own component and
CR. Remove that CR before applying the new bundle; leaving it in place is not
safe even once it is `complete`. Its `interruptionBudget` is independent of
the merged `tuning` CR's, and it keeps enrolling every GPU node that matches
its selector, so a node that joins later runs both CRs and reboots twice.

1. Wait until the old CR reports `complete`
   (`kubectl get nodewright rdma-netns-exclusive -o jsonpath='{.status.status}'`)
   so that removing it does not cut a node off mid-stage. If it cannot
   complete, pause it instead (`kubectl annotate nodewright
   rdma-netns-exclusive nodewright.nvidia.com/pause=true`): pause suspends the
   running stage, whereas `disable` lets in-flight work finish.
2. Remove the old component so that nothing recreates the CR:
   - Helm or helmfile: `helm uninstall rdma-netns-exclusive -n nodewright`.
     The bundler stripped the CR's Helm hook annotations, so the CR belongs
     to the release and is deleted with it.
   - Argo CD (`argocd` or `argocd-helm`): turn off automated sync on the
     parent Application (`nvidia-stack` or `aicr-stack` by default), then
     delete the `rdma-netns-exclusive` child Application. Applying the new
     bundle's parent Application turns automated sync back on.
   - Flux: suspend the Kustomization that reconciles the bundle
     (`flux suspend kustomization <name>`), then delete the
     `rdma-netns-exclusive` `HelmRelease` from the Flux namespace
     (`flux-system` by default). Leave the Kustomization suspended until
     step 4.
3. Delete the CR if it remains, and confirm it is gone. Argo CD leaves it
   behind unless cascade delete is enabled, and under Flux it is still a Helm
   hook, which an uninstall does not remove:

   ```shell
   kubectl delete nodewright rdma-netns-exclusive   # cluster-scoped
   kubectl get nodewright rdma-netns-exclusive      # expect NotFound
   ```

4. Apply the new bundle. Under Flux, commit and push it, run
   `flux reconcile source git <repository>` so the source serves the new
   revision, and only then resume the Kustomization
   (`flux resume kustomization <name>`). Resuming against the old revision
   re-creates the `rdma-netns-exclusive` `HelmRelease`, and its hook
   re-creates the legacy CR.

The package has no uninstall step, so removing the CR leaves the host setting
in place. The first rollout of the merged CR re-applies the RDMA package on
already-tuned nodes, which costs one more reboot per GPU node.

## Coordinating on a Shared Reference Cluster

Coordination on a shared VR200 reference cluster is a **results-validity**
requirement, not a stability one. `nvidia-tuned` allows multiple Skyhook CRs
to coexist in `complete` state; adding this recipe's `tuning` CR alongside
an out-of-band tuning CR means the profile actually in effect is decided by
priority ordering. A measurement taken as-is would be ambiguous about which
configuration it describes. Deconflict before running validation or capturing
evidence.

## Preview Boundary and Known Gaps

This coordinate is Preview, not Supported. Explicit gaps beyond the [Preview
recipes definition](recipe-development.md#preview-recipes):

- **SKU auto-detection cannot identify `vr200` yet.** The pre-release driver
  reports the generic `NVIDIA Graphics Device` placeholder, so
  snapshot-backed recipe generation on VR200 hardware resolves
  `accelerator: any`; the coordinate must be selected explicitly with
  `--accelerator vr200` (or the equivalent query parameter).
- **`Deployment.gpu-operator.version >= v26.7.0` does not gate
  `nvidia-dra-driver-gpu`'s deployed version.** No per-component deployment
  check exists for the DRA driver. The current registry default is
  `nvidia-dra-driver-gpu` 0.5.0 (bumped together with `gpu-operator`
  v26.7.0 in [#2439](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/2439)), which
  matches the constraint; but an independently upgraded / downgraded /
  older-bundle cluster can pass the `gpu-operator` gate while still running
  the previous 0.4.1 default, which crash-loops on VR200's NVML arch value.
- **Upstream `nodewright-packages` defects** affect settings the recipe
  configures but cannot enforce (containerd `LimitSTACK` drop-in targets an
  inactive unit on stock RKE2; the `vr200` `[bootloader]` stanza requests
  `hugepagesz=1G hugepages=2` against a 64k-page kernel that has no 1 GiB
  pool; `configure_bootloader.sh` duplicates TuneD's native
  `$tuned_params` hook). Tracked upstream at NVIDIA/nodewright-packages#134
  / #135 / #136.
