# GKE GB200 (A4X) Networking Prerequisites

For the **GB200 GKE COS** recipes (`gb200-gke-cos-training`,
`gb200-gke-cos-training-kubeflow`, `gb200-gke-cos-training-slurm`,
`gb200-gke-cos-inference`, and `gb200-gke-cos-inference-dynamo`, all on
`a4x-highgpu-4g` nodes),
GPUDirect-RDMA over RoCE enables high-speed inter-node GPU communication on
GKE. AICR's own GB200/GKE validation workload sets `NCCL_NET=gIB` explicitly
(see `recipes/components/gke-gb200-rdma/manifests/nccl-gib-installer-arm64.yaml`
and the runtime it applies,
`validators/performance/testdata/gb200/gke/runtime-nvls.yaml`) rather than
letting NCCL auto-select a plugin, so a missing or misconfigured RDMA fabric
doesn't silently fall back to a slower network path. It fails outright
instead.

This fail-closed behavior belongs to the validation workload, not to every
workload the recipe can run. For Kubeflow, the
`gb200-gke-cos-training-kubeflow` leaf also ships that wiring pre-built, as
[the `torch-distributed-rdma`
runtime](#the-shipped-torch-distributed-rdma-runtime) below. A workload that
uses the generic `torch-distributed` runtime instead, or authors its own
`TrainingRuntime`, carries none of it.

GPUDirect RDMA on `a4x-highgpu-4g` is also incompatible with NCCL Fast
Socket and the GPUDirect TCPX/TCPXO plugin (see
[GKE TCPXO Networking](gke-tcpxo-networking.md) for that alternative,
non-RDMA path); don't enable either on a cluster that uses RDMA.

## Infrastructure Prerequisites

GKE clusters must have multi-networking configured before deploying AICR bundles:

- Multi-networking enabled (1 gVNIC + 4 RDMA NICs per `a4x-highgpu-4g` node)
- `Network` + `GKENetworkParamSet` CRs for the gVNIC and 4 RDMA NICs (cluster-specific
  VPC/subnet values, but fixed object names; see below, not managed by AICR)
- `nccl-rdma-installer` DaemonSet on GPU nodes (included in the AICR bundle)
- Each GPUDirect-RDMA workload Pod must request all 4 GPUs and use all 4 RDMA NICs
  on a single node; RDMA can't be shared between Pods on the same node (a GKE
  `a4x-highgpu-4g` constraint, not an AICR-specific one). AICR's own recipes
  already request whole nodes this way; a custom workload built against this
  component must too.

The `nccl-rdma-installer` DaemonSet ships in the AICR bundle. The `Network`/
`GKENetworkParamSet` CRs and the multi-networking/VPC fabric underneath them
are **cluster provisioning**: AICR's `gke-gb200-rdma` health check detects
them but does not create them.

### Provisioning multi-networking

These steps are ordered, following Google's
[A4X custom setup guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/create/gke-ai-hypercompute-custom-a4x):

1. **Create the VPCs and subnets**: two VPCs in the cluster's region, one for
   the gVNIC (with one subnet) and one RDMA VPC (with four subnets, one per
   RDMA NIC); five subnets total across the two VPCs, not five separate VPCs.
2. **Create the cluster** with multi-networking enabled (HIPPO's `GKECluster` CR
   does this via `spec.networks.managed.gb200NetworkStrategy`).
3. **Apply the `Network` and `GKENetworkParamSet` CRs**, one pair per NIC,
   binding each additional node network into the cluster so pods can reference
   it. Unlike TCPXO (see [GKE TCPXO Networking](gke-tcpxo-networking.md)), the
   **object names are fixed, not cluster-specific**: `gvnic-1` for the gVNIC and
   `rdma-0` through `rdma-3` for the RDMA NICs. Only the `vpc`/`vpcSubnet` fields
   inside each `GKENetworkParamSet` vary per cluster (they name the VPC/subnet
   your cluster actually has):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: GKENetworkParamSet
metadata:
  name: gvnic-1
spec:
  vpc: "PREFIX-gvnic"
  vpcSubnet: "PREFIX-gvnic"
  deviceMode: NetDevice
---
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: gvnic-1
spec:
  type: "Device"
  parametersRef:
    group: networking.gke.io
    kind: GKENetworkParamSet
    name: gvnic-1
```

   Repeat for `rdma-0` through `rdma-3`, pointing `vpc` at the single RDMA VPC
   from step 1 (the same value for all four) and `vpcSubnet` at that VPC's
   four subnets (`PREFIX-rdma-sub-0` through `PREFIX-rdma-sub-3`, or whatever
   names your subnets were given in step 1, with `PREFIX` replaced by your
   own), and set **`deviceMode: RDMA`** on all four, not `NetDevice` (that
   value is only correct for `gvnic-1` above).

> **The fixed naming is a requirement, not a convention.** AICR's
> `checks/gke-gb200-rdma/health-check.yaml` asserts these five objects by exact
> name (`gvnic-1`, `rdma-0`..`rdma-3`), including `spec.deviceMode` and
> `spec.parametersRef` linkage. A cluster provisioned with different `Network`
> names passes Google's own setup guide but fails this check; rename to match
> before running `aicr validate`.

4. **Create the GPU node pool** on an `a4x-highgpu-4g` machine type, attaching
   the five network/subnet pairs as `additionalNodeNetworkConfigs` (the RDMA
   VPC repeated across its four subnets, plus the gVNIC VPC/subnet).

AICR installs the `nccl-rdma-installer` DaemonSet and detects the CRs; it does
not provision the networking itself. These steps are a summary of the
prerequisite AICR depends on, not a complete provisioning runbook; follow
Google's guide above for the full procedure, including firewall rules and
supported GKE version floors.

Separately from GKE's own networking version floor, all AICR GB200 GKE
recipes (including `gb200-gke-cos-training-slurm`, which inherits it from
`gb200-gke-cos-training`) enforce `K8s.server.version >= 1.34`: NVLS
provisions the IMEX channel through a DRA `ComputeDomain`, which requires
the GA `resource.k8s.io/v1` API. `aicr validate` fails readiness on an
older control plane with this constraint by name.

### Verifying

```shell
kubectl get network.networking.gke.io \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,PARAMETERS-REF:.spec.parametersRef.name'
kubectl get gkenetworkparamset.networking.gke.io \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,DEVICE-MODE:.spec.deviceMode'
```

Expect `gvnic-1` and `rdma-0` through `rdma-3` (the five prerequisite
`Network`s from step 3), each bound to its `GKENetworkParamSet` via
`spec.parametersRef` (shown in the `PARAMETERS-REF` column above). Fewer
than five, or a `GKENetworkParamSet` with the wrong `DEVICE-MODE`, means
the prerequisite is incomplete or misconfigured; `aicr validate` (via the
`gke-gb200-rdma` health check) reports the shortfall by name.

You'll also see a `default` network/`GKENetworkParamSet` pair in the same
output; that one is GKE-managed (created automatically once
multi-networking is enabled), not part of this prerequisite, and isn't
checked by name.

## The shipped `torch-distributed-rdma` runtime

On the `gb200-gke-cos-training-kubeflow` recipe, AICR ships a pre-wired
`ClusterTrainingRuntime` named `torch-distributed-rdma` (a sibling of
`torch-distributed`, which stays as it is). It carries the
`networking.gke.io` pod annotations mapping `eth1` to `gvnic-1` and `eth2`
through `eth5` to `rdma-0` through `rdma-3`, the
`/home/kubernetes/bin/nvidia` and `/home/kubernetes/bin/gib` host mounts,
`NCCL_NET=gIB`, `IPC_LOCK`, and the whole-node 4-GPU request, so a TrainJob
references it by name and supplies no fabric configuration at all:

```yaml
spec:
  runtimeRef:
    name: torch-distributed-rdma
    apiGroup: trainer.kubeflow.org
    kind: ClusterTrainingRuntime
  trainer:
    numNodes: 2                      # the shipped default; override freely
    image: my-registry/my-trainer:latest
```

**Do not set `resourcesPerNode`.** On the pinned Kubeflow Trainer v2.2.0 a
TrainJob value replaces the runtime's resource requirements outright rather
than merging, so a job that sets it loses the `nvidia.com/gpu: "4"` request
and with it the whole node. RDMA cannot be shared between Pods on a node, so
that failure takes the fabric with it. If you must set it, repeat every
resource in it, including the GPU request.

**No recipe-generation input is required.** `gvnic-1` and `rdma-0` through
`rdma-3` are fixed object names on every GB200/GKE cluster, so the runtime
renders unconditionally and has no unset path that could ship it half-wired.

**The runtime does not apply upstream's NCCL tuning profile.** The gIB
installer lays that profile down on the host at
`/home/kubernetes/bin/gib/scripts/set_nccl_env.sh`. A `ClusterTrainingRuntime`
cannot source it, because Kubeflow Trainer owns the container command, so a
workload that wants it sources the file from its own `spec.trainer.command`.
AICR's own NVLS performance validator does exactly that (see
`validators/performance/testdata/gb200/gke/runtime-nvls.yaml`). Skipping it
costs tuning, not correctness, because `NCCL_NET=gIB` from the runtime is what
selects the fabric.

Overriding `command` replaces the `torchrun` invocation Trainer injects, so
the override has to launch it. Pass no rendezvous flags. Trainer sets
`PET_NNODES`, `PET_NPROC_PER_NODE`, `PET_NODE_RANK`, `PET_MASTER_ADDR` and
`PET_MASTER_PORT` on the container, and `torchrun` reads each one as the
default for the matching flag, so a hand-written flag can only contradict the
job it was launched under.

```yaml
spec:
  trainer:
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
    args:
      - |
        if [ -f /home/kubernetes/bin/gib/scripts/set_nccl_env.sh ]; then
          . /home/kubernetes/bin/gib/scripts/set_nccl_env.sh
        fi
        exec torchrun train.py
```

## Driver Installer

`a4x-highgpu-4g` recipes generated with `--profile gpuStack=bundle-installer`
(see [GKE GPU Setup](gke-gpu-setup.md#alternative-let-the-bundle-own-the-gpu-stack))
get the driver from the bundle's `gcp-driver-installer` component — Google's
cos-gpu-installer DaemonSet, deployed and versioned by AICR alongside the
rest of the bundle, no manual DaemonSet apply required. This presumes the
node-pool prerequisite (pools created with `gpu-driver-version=disabled`
plus the `gke-no-default-nvidia-gpu-device-plugin=true` label) is already in
place; the component's `nodeAffinity` requires that label itself, so it
never schedules onto a pool that hasn't opted out of GKE's managed install.

**GB200-specific wrinkle:** the component's default `partitionGpuImage` (its
`partition-gpus` init container, Google's `nvidia-partition-gpu` MIG tool —
a no-op here since this recipe allocates whole GPUs per node rather than
configuring MIG) is pinned to an amd64-only digest and fails with
`exec format error` on GB200's arm64 nodes. AICR's `gb200-gke-cos-training`
and `gb200-gke-cos-inference` overlays (and everything based on them) set
`gcp-driver-installer.partitionGpuImage` to a multi-arch digest
automatically — found via live GB200 GKE validation, no action needed:

```yaml
partitionGpuImage: "gcr.io/gke-release/nvidia-partition-gpu@sha256:de12f85ebfb4fb6c1893cd30c23aab662a72fa0448f97ef74fccb82d7522ef17"
```

The driver version itself (`gcp-driver-installer.driverVersion`) needs no
GB200-specific override: the component's default is
[COS-qualified](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus#cos)
for GB200 (see the component's `values.yaml` for the qualified COS builds).

### Validate the RDMA prerequisite before deploying

The `gcp-driver-installer` component deploys and orders itself ahead of the
GPU Operator automatically within `deploy.sh` (see [Driver
Installer](#driver-installer)) — there's nothing to hand-apply or pre-check
for the driver anymore. The RDMA `Network`/`GKENetworkParamSet` CRs are
still a true cluster-provisioning prerequisite applied before the node pool
exists (see [Provisioning multi-networking](#provisioning-multi-networking)
above); confirm they're in place before running the bundle's full
`deploy.sh` with the `kubectl` commands in [Verifying](#verifying). The
`gke-gb200-rdma` health check itself asserts the bundle's
`nccl-rdma-installer` DaemonSet is fully rolled out with healthy Pods, on
top of the CRs, so it (and every other `deployment`-phase check) reports
the bundle's own components as missing until `deploy.sh` has actually
deployed them.

Once `deploy.sh` has deployed the bundle, `aicr validate --phase
deployment` against the bundle's `recipe.yaml` (the component set it
deployed) checks it, including `gke-gb200-rdma`, without running
conformance or performance (see [Validation](../user/validation.md)):

```shell
aicr validate --recipe ./bundle/recipe.yaml --phase deployment
```

## Storage Prerequisites

`a4x-highgpu-4g` nodes can't attach Persistent Disk at all (regional or
zonal, any type, including `pd-balanced`); only Hyperdisk. On a stock GKE
Standard cluster the default StorageClass is `standard-rwo`
(`pd.csi.storage.gke.io`, `pd-balanced`), but "default" isn't inherent to
GKE Standard itself: a cluster admin can repoint the
`storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation to any
StorageClass. Run `kubectl get storageclass` first and check which one is
annotated `(default)`, its `PROVISIONER`, and (via `kubectl get
storageclass -o yaml`) its `parameters.type`; don't assume it's
`standard-rwo`/`pd-balanced`. Any PVC scheduled onto a GB200 node with no
`storageClassName` set (which binds it to the cluster default) fails
this way unless that default's `parameters.type` is already
Hyperdisk-backed: `pd-balanced disk type cannot be used by
a4x-highgpu-4g machine type` (or the equivalent for whatever `pd-*` type
the default actually provisions).

This includes the `inference-perf` validator's model-weights cache PVC,
which the populate Job pins to the a4x node. The
`gb200-gke-cos-inference-dynamo` recipe provisions its own StorageClass
for this, `a4x-compatible` (`pd.csi.storage.gke.io`,
`parameters.type: hyperdisk-balanced`; see
`recipes/components/dynamo-platform/manifests/a4x-storage-class.yaml`),
and points the `inference-model-cache-storage-class` performance
constraint at it. It is not the cluster default, so it has no effect on
PVCs scheduled elsewhere, including CPU node pools that can't attach
Hyperdisk. No manual setup is needed for this PVC.

Override it only to reuse a differently named, already-Hyperdisk-backed
StorageClass instead: set `inference-model-cache-storage-class` on the
recipe overlay, or `AICR_INFERENCE_PERF_MODEL_CACHE_STORAGE_CLASS=<name>`
on the `inference-perf` catalog entry's `env`. AICR's compatibility check
accepts `hyperdisk-balanced`, `hyperdisk-ml`, or `hyperdisk-extreme` (see
[Validation](../user/validation.md)).

When overriding to a StorageClass this bundle doesn't own, for example one
that already exists on the cluster under the name AICR would otherwise
create, also pass `--set dynamo-platform:a4xStorageClass.create=false` at
bundle time, so AICR doesn't render the `a4x-compatible` manifest at all.

## Running the NCCL Benchmark

The GB200 GKE training recipe (`gb200-gke-cos-training`) selects the
NVLS-variant performance check (`nccl-all-reduce-bw-nvls`): MNNVL across the
A4X nodes' IMEX domain is the fabric that carries all-reduce traffic; gIB is the
transport driver underneath, not the NCCL algorithm itself. Run it via:

```shell
aicr validate --recipe recipes/overlays/gb200-gke-cos-training.yaml \
  --phase performance
```
