# Recipe Health

This page reports the **structural health** of every recipe AICR can resolve — one row per leaf criteria combination (service × accelerator × OS × intent × platform). It answers *"across the whole matrix, what is the current structural state of each recipe?"* and is the catalog-wide complement to per-recipe [conformance evidence](../design/007-recipe-evidence.md). For a family carrying an ADR-015 configuration profile (`gpuStack` on AKS and GKE), the row grades the composition resolved at the **declaration default** (`azure-managed` on AKS, `gke-default` on GKE); per-profile-value rows are a follow-up.

The matrix is computed **hermetically and offline**: every signal is a pure read of the resolved recipe — no Helm render, no GPU, no cluster, no network. It is regenerated from the recipe catalog by `make recipe-health-docs` and is kept current by a weekly bot PR. `make recipe-health-check` is an advisory staleness check (it is **not** wired into `make qualify` or the merge gate). The full design is recorded in [ADR-009](../design/009-recipe-health-tracking.md).

## What the columns mean

**Status** is the rolled-up structural verdict per recipe:

- `pass` — the recipe is structurally sound.
- `warn` — a non-fatal structural concern was surfaced.
- `fail` — a graded structural signal failed (e.g. the recipe does not resolve).
- `unknown` — a transient resolver error (a re-runnable timeout) prevented a confident verdict; the recipe is held rather than penalized. `unknown` is never silently read as `pass`.

> **Structural soundness is not a validation verdict.** A recipe that resolves cleanly is *structurally sound*, **not** *validated and performant*. Runtime/validation claims come only from signed conformance evidence, which is out of scope for this matrix today (see the Evidence column below).

**chart_pinned (folded into Status).** One of the graded signals behind `Status` checks that every resolved Helm component references an explicit chart version, per [ADR-006](../design/006-image-pinning-policy.md). This is **layer 1 only** — the chart-version pin — *not* image-digest pinning, and it is a render-free read of the resolved recipe (it does not pull or template the chart).

**Coverage** is a descriptor — it is *never* graded, so a deliberately minimal recipe is never penalized for declaring fewer checks. It is a compact per-phase summary of the **declared** validation checks, in the form `R:n D:n P:n C:n` — the count of named checks declared for the readiness, deployment, performance, and conformance phases respectively.

**Evidence** deep-links each recipe that has a live dashboard presence to its coordinate on the AICR evidence dashboard at [validation.aicr.run](https://validation.aicr.run) (`/#/<group>/<dashboard>/<tab>`, where `group` is the service, `dashboard` is `<accelerator>-<os>`, and `tab` is `<intent>[-<platform>]`). A recipe without a committed presence entry stays a literal `pending` — the column reports the absence of a **committed linkable presence**, not necessarily the absence of live evidence (profiled families' entries are deliberately withheld until profile-aware links land, so their rows read `pending` even when the dashboard holds per-value evidence). Today the dashboard covers only the UAT-driven coordinates, so most rows are `pending` until real-hardware coverage broadens; this matrix does not gate on that.

The link is constructed **hermetically and deterministically** from the recipe's resolved criteria using the shared `pkg/recipe.CoordinateFor` mapping — the generator makes no network call, and the coordinate carries **no Kubernetes version**, so a link is stable across k8s-version rolls. The Evidence cell is a link and nothing more: it points at the live board and carries **no** pass/fail state or count. Which recipes are linked is driven by a committed presence manifest (`pkg/testgrid/presence.yaml`); a weekly, warning-only bot keeps it honest by reporting any link that no longer resolves against the live dashboard data (it never blocks merges or edits this doc).

> **Community-source posture is author-asserted provenance, not independently-verified correctness.** A coordinate's tab placement and any community-sourced results on the dashboard are declared by the signing author; corroboration counts agreement at the same AICR version but does not itself certify runtime correctness. Read the linked board accordingly.

The deep-link is the current Evidence rendering. It is distinct from — and coexists with — [ADR-009](../design/009-recipe-health-tracking.md)'s deferred, verify-gated *in-cell freshness* state (`unattested` vs aged, derived from a signed attestation's `AttestedAt`): the link points at the live board, and an optional freshness token can later annotate the same cell without replacing the link. See also the [coverage matrix](coverage-matrix.md) for the complementary breadth view.
