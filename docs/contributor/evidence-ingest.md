# Evidence Ingest (GP2)

The evidence-ingest pipeline turns a **published, signed** recipe-evidence
bundle into the **source-keyed tree** that the corroboration dashboard
generator consumes. It is the bridge between the per-run attestation
bundles produced by `aicr validate --emit-attestation --push` (see
[ADR-007](../design/007-recipe-evidence.md)) and the aggregated,
consensus view. The tree it writes is rendered and served by
[dashboard-publish (GP5)](evidence-dashboard-publish.md).

The `GPn` labels name stages of the evidence-corroboration pipeline (epic #1400):
**GP1** signer-allowlist management (`recipes/evidence/allowlist.yaml`),
**GP2** ingest/verify (this doc), **GP3** dashboard infrastructure
(`infra/evidence-dashboard`), **GP4** consensus/corroboration
(`pkg/corroborate`), and **GP5** dashboard publish.

Its defining property is **verify-before-count**: a bundle's signature,
issuer, identity, and source registry are all checked in a step that
holds no bucket-write credentials, *before* any of its results are
recorded. Unverified evidence never reaches the tree, and contributors
never hold credentials to the publish bucket.

## Pipeline

```
pointer / bundle ref
        │
        ▼
  materialize (ORAS pull, digest-pinned)
        │
        ▼
  verify  ── issuer + identity pins, signature, registry allowlist
        │        (credential-free; fails closed)
        ▼
  classify (allowlist → class + allowlisted)
        │
        ▼
  synthesize  results/<group>/<dashboard>/<tab>/<idHash>/<runId>/
        │         meta.json + ctrf/<phase>.json
        ▼
  publish (separate, credentialed step) → GCS
```

The Go pieces:

- `pkg/evidence/project` — the synthesis library. Pure and offline: given
  an already-verified bundle plus its verified signer claims, it derives
  the coordinate and signer id-hash and writes the run directory. It
  performs no verification and no network I/O of its own.
- `tools/evidence-project` — the CLI that wires it together: resolve the
  OCI ref, enforce the trusted-registry allowlist, materialize once,
  verify on the unpacked directory with non-empty pins
  (`pkg/evidence/verifier`), classify, then synthesize.
- `.github/workflows/evidence-ingest.yaml` + `.github/scripts/evidence-ingest.sh`
  — the CI driver with two triggers (below) and a fork-safe split between
  the credential-free verify job and the credentialed publish job.

## Triggers

1. **Push to `recipes/evidence/**`** — community and partner pointers
   added or refreshed in-tree. Each changed pointer is verified with the
   signature pinned to the signer the pointer *claims*; the verifier also
   cross-checks the certificate against that claim, so a pointer cannot
   lie about who signed.
2. **`workflow_call` / `workflow_dispatch` with `bundle_ref`** — a
   first-party UAT run ingests its bundle directly, by ref, with no repo
   commit. The signature is pinned to the NVIDIA/aicr Actions identity.
   `uat-aws.yaml`, `uat-gcp.yaml`, `uat-azure.yaml`, and — for real-silicon
   `service: kind` recipes on the self-hosted GPU runners — `uat-kind.yaml`
   (DC5 #1278) call this workflow as a dependent `ingest-evidence` job on a
   successful run, passing the digest-pinned ref read from the conformance
   step's `evidence/pointer.yaml`. The nvkind lane is a sibling of the cloud
   lanes: dispatched by the shared `uat-run.yaml` from the `kind-h100`
   reservation row and scoped to H100 x1, single-GPU (whatever the runner
   physically has).

## Downstream publishes

A successful ingest lands new evidence in the bucket, so the last job,
`trigger-publishes`, dispatches the two downstream consumers of that
evidence:

- [`evidence-dashboard-publish.yaml`](evidence-dashboard-publish.md), to
  re-render the static evidence dashboard.
- `testgrid-publish.yml` (TG5), passing the same verified, digest-pinned
  `bundle_ref` this ingest consumed — but only for the first-party UAT path
  (`bundle_ref` set) on `main` or a `release/*` ref. A feature-branch UAT or a
  push-triggered community/partner ingest does not dispatch TestGrid
  automatically; an allowlisted external bundle can be backfilled manually.

TestGrid treats every dispatch as a hint, not as proof of provenance. Before it
exchanges GCP credentials, it independently pulls the immutable bundle, verifies
its signature, and derives trust from the checked-in signer allowlist:

- a verified NVIDIA UAT identity on `main` or `release/*` becomes
  `source_class=uat`;
- a verified, allowlisted community or partner identity becomes
  `source_class=community`; and
- unsigned, unallowlisted, untrusted-registry, feature-branch first-party, or
  unexpected-class bundles fail closed.

The workflow has no caller-controlled source-class input, so a manual backfill
cannot promote external evidence to first-party UAT.

Both dispatches run `needs: publish`, so they inherit the
`produced == 'true'` gate — a no-op ingest (allowlist-only change, deleted
pointer) never fires either.

The push-to-`main` ingest path already re-triggers the dashboard through
that workflow's own `push:` trigger; the dispatch exists for the
**first-party UAT path**, which reaches this workflow as a nested
`workflow_call` (`uat-run` → `uat-{aws,gcp,azure}` → `evidence-ingest`,
already at GitHub's four-level reuse limit). A nested call emits no
top-level run event and cannot nest a fifth reusable workflow, so a
`workflow_dispatch` is the only way to start a fresh top-level run — for
the dashboard or for TestGrid — from that depth. It needs `actions:
write`, threaded down from the `uat-run` `run-*` jobs through each cloud
pipeline's `ingest-evidence` job.

The dashboard's `concurrency: { group: pages, cancel-in-progress: false }`
serializes to one running build and one queued build, the newest dispatch
superseding the queued one — so a multi-cell nightly batch collapses its
flurry of ingests into a single coalesced rebuild rather than a backlog.
Both dispatches are best-effort: a transient failure warns instead of
failing the calling UAT run, and either can be backfilled manually
afterward.

## meta.json

Each run directory carries one `meta.json` (schema
`aicr-corroboration-meta/v1`). It is the **authoritative** coordinate
source — the directory layout is organizational only. There is no clock
and no randomness, so output is byte-identical across runs from
identical input. Fields fall into five provenance classes:

- **content-verified** — from the verified predicate or the verified
  bundle's recipe bytes.
- **certificate-verified** — from the verified Fulcio certificate.
- **workflow-derived** — produced by the verification workflow itself
  (the Rekor lookup).
- **allowlist-derived** — the `Allowlist.Classify` verdict over the
  verified signer.
- **caller-supplied** — operational metadata the ingest caller passes
  in; recorded as-is, not covered by the signature.

| Field | Class | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | constant | `aicr-corroboration-meta/v1` |
| `coordinate.{group,dashboard,tab}` | content-verified | `recipe.CoordinateFor` over the bundle recipe's criteria |
| `recipe` | content-verified | predicate `recipe.name` |
| `profile` | content-verified | lowercase profile path segment (`<name>-<value>`) appended to `coordinate.tab` for profile-bearing recipes; omitted for unprofiled runs. Consumers inverting the coordinate back to criteria strip `-<profile>` from the tab first |
| `profileSelection` | content-verified | exact-case `name=value` wire-form selection for profile-bearing recipes (omitted otherwise) — the lowercase `profile` segment is lossy, so consumers reconstructing the selection (the dashboard's copy-CLI/copy-config generators) read this field |
| `signer.idHash` | certificate-verified | `SignerIDHash(issuer, identity)` — the source dedup key |
| `signer.identity` / `signer.issuer` | certificate-verified | the **verified** cert SAN + OIDC issuer |
| `signer.class` / `signer.allowlisted` | allowlist-derived | classification (below) |
| `runId` | caller-supplied (default content-verified) | `--run-id` when passed; else derived as `run-<attestedAt:YYYYMMDDThhmm>` |
| `aicrVersion` | content-verified | predicate `aicrVersion` |
| `k8sVersion` | content-verified | predicate `fingerprint.k8sVersion.value` |
| `k8sConstraint` | content-verified | the recipe's `K8s.server.version` constraint |
| `bundleDigest` | content-verified | predicate `manifest.digest` |
| `evidenceRef` | caller-supplied | OCI ref of the signed bundle, as passed by the ingest caller |
| `rekorLogIndex` | workflow-derived | verified Rekor index (omitted when absent) |
| `attestedAt` | content-verified | predicate `attestedAt` (the only timestamp) |

`ctrf/<phase>.json` reports are copied for each phase the run produced
(`deployment`, `performance`, `conformance`); a phase the run did not
produce is simply absent — never stubbed.

## idHash (producer ↔ consumer contract)

`idHash` is the stable per-signer dedup key the consensus model counts
distinct values of. It is

```
idHash = first 32 hex chars (128 bits) of sha256(issuer + "\n" + identity)
```

defined once in `project.SignerIDHash`. The same verified signer hashes
to the same value across every recipe and run; two different signers do
not collide. This is the GP2-producer/GP4-consumer contract — do not
change the algorithm without migrating both the bucket tree and the
consumer.

## Classification

`project.Allowlist.Classify` derives a signer's trust tier from the
**verified** `(issuer, identity)`, never a raw pointer string:

1. With an allowlist loaded, the shared loader (`pkg/evidence/allowlist`,
   the same one the GP4 consumer `pkg/corroborate` uses) decides: a slug or
   pattern match wins, `allowlisted=true`.
2. When no allowlist file is loaded (no `--allowlist` flag), a built-in
   heuristic admits AICR's own UAT identity (GitHub Actions OIDC +
   `NVIDIA/aicr`) as `first-party` so it is not mislabeled.
3. Otherwise `community`, `allowlisted=false` — the fail-closed default.
   Reported, but never counted toward consensus.

The canonical `recipes/evidence/allowlist.yaml` keys first-party CI signers
by an anchored `identityPattern` and external contributors/partners by a
one-way `source` slug — it deliberately does **not** store a cleartext
`identity` field (the loader rejects one, to keep personal emails out of the
repo):

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1.0.0
firstParty:
  - label: aicr-uat-aws
    issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
    identityPattern: '^https://github\.com/NVIDIA/aicr/\.github/workflows/uat-aws\.yaml@refs/heads/.+$'
community:
  # Keyed by source slug only — first 32 hex of sha256(issuer + "\n" + identity).
  - issuer: https://github.com/login/oauth
    source: 7c4c0edc8c765a95a0f3afdb3bbb8e91
partner: []
```

`identityPattern` is a `^…$`-anchored regex (full-string match); the loader
rejects an over-broad pattern (any wildcard left of the OIDC subject's `@` —
only the ref may vary) and overlapping entries, so the allowlist cannot
itself be used to manufacture consensus.

Both the GP2 ingest loader (`pkg/evidence/project`) and the GP4 consumer
(`pkg/corroborate`) delegate to the shared canonical loader in
`pkg/evidence/allowlist` (#1505), so producer and consumer parse the
identical `identityPattern`/`source` schema and classify a verified signer
identically. The shared loader rejects a cleartext `identity:` field, so
personal emails cannot be reintroduced by accident.

## Forward limitations

- Today's `pkg/evidence/verifier` populates a verified signer only from
  an in-artifact `attestation.intoto.jsonl` (DSSE + Fulcio cert). The
  "statement-only bundle whose signer is carried in the pointer and
  verified against Rekor by digest" shape is not yet implemented, so such
  community bundles cannot be ingested — the producer fails closed rather
  than record an unverified signer.
- Discovery walks the per-source nested layout
  `recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/<digest>.yaml` (the
  `<recipe>/<src>/*.yaml` glob in `pkg/evidence/verifier/discover.go`); a
  flat `recipes/evidence/<recipe>.yaml` is rejected as an unexpected root file.
- The publish job writes to `gs://aicr-testgrid-staging/results` using the
  shared eidosx WIF service account from `uat-gcp.yaml`. GP3 will replace
  it with a dedicated `objectCreator`-only identity scoped to that prefix.
