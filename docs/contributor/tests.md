# Testing AICR

AICR's test pyramid has five layers. Unit tests are the broad base —
table-driven, hermetic, `--no-cluster`. Above them sit integration
tests against a real Kubernetes API (Kind), Chainsaw post-deploy
health checks, KWOK matrix tests that exercise scheduling shape and
deployer output without GPU hardware, and E2E tests that drive the
built `aicr` binary through hermetic Chainsaw CLI suites
(`--no-cluster`). Testing on real GPU clusters is [UAT](uat.md),
outside this pyramid.

> **What to use when.** If the code path can be exercised without
> the Kubernetes API, write a unit test. If it cannot, prefer KWOK
> or Chainsaw over Kind, and Kind over a UAT run on real hardware.

The pre-push gate is **`make qualify`**. It runs tests with the race
detector and coverage threshold, lints (golangci-lint + yamllint),
e2e, vulnerability scan, and license check. CI runs the equivalent plus a few
CI-only checks (see [The `make qualify` Gate](#the-make-qualify-gate)).

## Test Surfaces

| Surface | When to use | Lives in | Run locally | Gated by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit tests (Go)** | Logic exercisable without K8s API | `*_test.go` next to source | `make test` | `make qualify`, push CI |
| **Integration tests (Go)** | Logic touching the K8s API | `*_test.go` with envtest / fake client | `make test` (Kind for live cases) | `make qualify`, push CI |
| **Chainsaw health checks** | Component-level post-deploy health | `recipes/checks/<name>/health-check.yaml` | `make check-health COMPONENT=<name>` | UAT readiness gate (`aicr validate --phase deployment`), registry-linked checks only; statically by `TestValidateTestReadOnly_AllCheckFiles` under `make test`, which covers opt-in checks too |
| **KWOK matrix tests** | Recipe scheduling shape + deployer output without GPUs | `kwok/scripts/*`, `recipes/overlays/*` | `make kwok-test-deployer RECIPE=… DEPLOYER=…` | `kwok-recipes.yaml` workflow |
| **E2E tests** | CLI behavior through the built binary, no cluster | `tools/e2e`, `tests/chainsaw/{cli,signing,bundle-templates}/` | `unset GITLAB_TOKEN && ./tools/e2e` | `make qualify`, `CLI E2E` job in `qualification.yaml` |

The rest of this page covers each surface in the order a typical
change touches them — unit, integration, chainsaw, KWOK, E2E — plus
the `make qualify` gate and common gotchas.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are the default. Required patterns from
[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md):
table-driven cases, race detector enabled, no live cluster access.

**Table-driven** (mandatory for multiple cases):

```go
func TestParseCriteria(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid h100", "h100", "h100", false},
        {"empty rejected", "", "", true},
    }
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := Parse(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Fatalf("err=%v wantErr=%v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("got=%q want=%q", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

**Race detector** is always on:

```bash
go test -race ./...                          # full module
go test -race -v ./pkg/recipe/...            # single package
go test -race -v ./pkg/recipe -run TestX     # single test
```

**CLI tests capture `cmd.Writer`**, not stdout. CLI commands write
through `cmd.Root().Writer` so tests can intercept output:

```go
buf := &bytes.Buffer{}
cmd := recipeCmd()
cmd.Writer = buf
args := []string{"recipe", "--service", "eks", "--accelerator", "h100"}
if err := cmd.Run(context.Background(), args); err != nil {
    t.Fatalf("run: %v", err)
}
```

(The CLI is built on `urfave/cli/v3`: a command exposes a `Writer`
field and is invoked with `cmd.Run(ctx, args)` where `args[0]` is the
command name — there is no Cobra-style `SetOut`/`SetArgs`/`Execute`.)

Direct `fmt.Println` / `fmt.Printf` to stdout in `pkg/cli` breaks
this pattern and is a review-blocker.

**Coverage floor: 83%** (from `.settings.yaml`
`quality.coverage_threshold`; excludes `validators/`, see #1752). `make test-coverage` enforces it.
Per-package decreases > 0.5% are flagged for justification.

## Test Isolation (`--no-cluster`)

Any test that touches the validator or a collector **must** run with
`--no-cluster` set. Two reasons:

1. **Hermeticity.** A test that happens to have a kubeconfig pointed
   at a real cluster will connect to it and create resources. CI
   runners and laptops both fail this way silently otherwise.
2. **Speed.** No RBAC creation, no Job deployment, no waiting on pods.

**How to set it:**

```go
// Go unit/integration tests
v := validator.New(
    validator.WithNoCluster(true),
    validator.WithVersion(version),
)
```

```bash
# CLI invocations in tests, scripts, and chainsaw
aicr validate --recipe recipe.yaml --snapshot snapshot.yaml --no-cluster
```

```yaml
# Chainsaw scripts: always include --no-cluster on aicr invocations
- script:
    content: |
      ${AICR_BIN} validate -r recipe.yaml -s snapshot.yaml --no-cluster
```

**Behavior with `NoCluster=true`:** the validator skips ServiceAccount /
Role / ClusterRole creation, skips Job deployment for container-per-validator
checks, and reports each check as `"skipped — no-cluster mode (test
mode)"`. **Constraints are still evaluated inline**, because constraint
evaluation reads the snapshot rather than the API server. A test that
asserts on validator output must therefore assert on the constraint
results, not on check results.

The option lives in [`pkg/validator/options.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/validator/options.go)
(`WithNoCluster`). Adding a new validator entry point that talks to
the API must respect this flag — the anti-patterns table treats live
cluster access in tests as a review-blocker.

## Coverage Gate Workflow

Before pushing a Go change, verify the per-package coverage delta on
the narrowest directory root your change touches. `$pkg/...` includes
descendants — pick the narrowest root that covers the diff.

```bash
# 1. Profile the working tree (changes must be committed first).
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./pkg/recipe/...

# 2. Profile origin/main from a clean worktree, outside the source tree.
git worktree add $TMPDIR/baseline origin/main \
  && (cd $TMPDIR/baseline && go test \
        -coverprofile=$TMPDIR/base.out ./pkg/recipe/...); \
  rc=$?; git worktree remove --force $TMPDIR/baseline; \
  (exit $rc)

# 3. Compare totals.
go tool cover -func=$TMPDIR/base.out | tail -1
go tool cover -func=cover.out          | tail -1
```

Writing the baseline profile to `$TMPDIR/base.out` is deliberate: a
profile inside the worktree disappears with `worktree remove --force`.

**Gates:**

- **Block** if `make test-coverage` fails (project-wide 83% floor).
- **Block** if any new exported function or method has 0% coverage
  in the diff — add tests before pushing.
- **Flag** any per-package decrease > 0.5% and explain in the PR.

Report the delta in the PR Testing section, e.g., `pkg/recipe:
90.4% → 90.3% (-0.1%)`. CI also posts per-package deltas via
`go-coverage-report` after push, but the local gate catches
regressions before push.

## Integration Tests (Kind)

When a test needs a real Kubernetes API — controller logic, RBAC
behavior, watch semantics — use Kind. `make dev-env` spins up a Kind
cluster and starts Tilt; `make dev-env-clean` tears it down. Prefer
`controller-runtime`'s `envtest` (local apiserver/etcd, no Kind) for
unit-scope controller tests; reserve Kind for cross-package or
deployer-output flows that need a full cluster.

```bash
make dev-env                    # Kind + Tilt running
make dev-env-clean              # delete cluster, stop Tilt
```

Live-cluster tests still set `--no-cluster` when the call path
includes the validator — the flag suppresses validator RBAC and Job
deployment; cluster-touching code under test is unaffected.

## Chainsaw Health Checks

Each component in the registry can carry an optional Chainsaw assert
YAML that runs after the bundle deploys to confirm the component is
healthy: pods Ready, services resolve, CRDs `Established`, custom
resources reach a known phase. The asserts live alongside the
component:

```text
recipes/checks/<component>/health-check.yaml
```

Discover them and run locally against a Kind cluster:

```bash
make check-health COMPONENT=gpu-operator       # single component
make check-health-all                           # registry-linked components
# opt-in-only checks (e.g. nvsentinel-observability,
# nvsentinel-preflight) aren't in that sweep -- run them directly:
make check-health COMPONENT=nvsentinel-observability
make check-health COMPONENT=nvsentinel-preflight
make validate-local RECIPE=recipe.yaml          # full pipeline
```

**When to add one:** the contributor wants to verify, after deploy,
that the component's pods reach Ready, its CRDs are `Established`,
its operator deploys its custom resources, or its services resolve.
Anything subtler than "is it alive" belongs in a container-per-validator
check (see [validator.md](validator.md)) so the assertion runs as part
of a tracked validation phase rather than a one-shot Chainsaw step.

**Always include `--no-cluster` on `aicr` invocations inside the
chainsaw script.** A chainsaw test that runs `aicr validate` without
the flag will attempt to install RBAC into the test cluster, which
diverges from the assertion's intent (the validator job is the unit
under test elsewhere).

Components with an assert file today include `gpu-operator`,
`network-operator`, `nfd`, `cert-manager`, `nvsentinel`, `kueue`,
`kubeflow-trainer`, `slinky-slurm`, and more — browse
[`recipes/checks/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/recipes/checks)
for the full list.

## KWOK Matrix Testing

KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) simulates a GPU cluster without
real hardware. CI uses it to validate two things per recipe:

1. **Scheduling shape.** Node selectors, tolerations, and resource
   requests render correctly and land pods on the simulated nodes
   the overlay expects.
2. **Deployer output correctness.** The same recipe is re-rendered
   through every output adapter — `helm`, `argocd-oci`,
   `argocd-helm-oci`, `argocd-git`, `flux-oci`, `flux-git` — and each
   renders to a working bundle the GitOps controllers can reconcile.

KWOK nodes have no kubelet, so pods never actually run. KWOK testing
**does not exercise** runtime validators (NCCL, inference-perf) or
component health — for those, see [validator.md](validator.md). If a
recipe's constraints reference dimensions the KWOK node profiles do
not provide (e.g., a GPU model no profile registers), the bundle
renders but pods stay Pending or land on the wrong nodes. Extend
`kwok/profiles/` rather than relax the recipe — KWOK is the
simulated reflection of production shape, not a relaxed substitute.

KWOK results are advisory. The `KWOK Test Summary (advisory)` check turns red
when a tier fails, but it does not block merges. The main branch ruleset
requires `gate` (the aggregate job in the `Merge Gate` workflow,
`merge-gate.yaml`) and `Check PR Title`. `gate` is the only required
qualification aggregate.

For the design rationale and the spike findings that justify the
chart pin and Repository-secret shape, see
[ADR-008](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/docs/design/008-kwok-deployer-matrix.md);

### Deployer Coverage Matrix

| Tier | Trigger | Deployers exercised |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Tier 1 — generic overlays | every PR + push | `helm` on every generic overlay, plus each other deployer on one probe overlay (`eks-training`) |
| Tier 2 — diff-aware accelerator overlays | PR only, conditional on changed files | `helm` only |
| Tier 3 — full overlay set | push to `main` + nightly schedule | `helm`, `argocd-oci`, `argocd-helm-oci`, `argocd-git`, `flux-oci`, `flux-git` |

| Lane | Pull artifact | Apply manifests | Reconcile to Ready |
|---|---|---|---|
| `helm` | n/a (filesystem) | `helm install` | pods scheduled |
| `argocd-oci` | repo-server OCI pull | Argo CD sync | `Synced+Healthy` |
| `argocd-helm-oci` | `helm pull` OCI | wrapper chart install | `Synced+Healthy` |
| `argocd-git` | repo-server Git clone (in-cluster Gitea) | Argo CD sync | root App Git `repoURL` + `Synced+Healthy` |
| `flux-oci` | source-controller OCI pull | kustomize-controller apply | all HelmReleases `Ready=True` + ArtifactGenerators Ready |
| `flux-git` | source-controller Git clone (in-cluster Gitea) | kustomize-controller apply | GitRepositories Ready + all HelmReleases `Ready=True` |

Tier 1 crosses the non-`helm` deployers with a single probe overlay to keep
the PR matrix small. The probe is `eks-training`, which carries more
components than the bare `eks` base, and falls back to the first generic
overlay when it is absent. GitOps templating regressions specific to a component that the
probe does not include are caught by Tier 3, which runs the full recipe x
deployer cross-product after merge.

Tier 2 stays `helm`-only because its job is to verify accelerator-specific
overlays still render correctly when their inputs change. The deployer
shape is orthogonal — re-running through Argo CD would only re-exercise
template rendering, which Tier 1 and Tier 3 already cover on the generic
overlays. The `flux-git` and `argocd-git` lanes cover the filesystem
(Git-source) round-trip of
[#963](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/963) for both GitOps
controllers, sharing the same in-cluster Gitea infrastructure.

### Inventory Read-Back

Every matrix cell ends by reading the bundle it just deployed back out of
the cluster and requiring the two answers to agree. `validate-scheduling.sh`
step 7 runs `aicr upgrade-check` twice against the same target recipe, once
with `--from cluster` and once with `--from <bundle-dir>`, and diffs the
per-component rows of the two JSON reports.

The bundle is the oracle. The `recipe.yaml` at its root lists exactly the
releases the bundler emitted, at exactly the versions it pinned, so there is
no golden to maintain and nothing to drift against: a per-component
divergence is by construction a defect in the cluster read. That matters
most for the deployers whose release naming is not the component's own name
(Flux composes `<targetNamespace>-<name>` and Argo CD prepends a settable
prefix), where a mapping that no longer matches reports an empty inventory
and a confident "every component is new". This is ADR-021 acceptance
criterion 4, and running it on the existing `{recipe, deployer}` matrix is
what makes the criterion's per-deployer requirement free.

Compared: the component name, the kind of change, the `from` and `to`
versions, and the verdict with the reason that produced it, plus the summary
counts. Excluded, because they differ by construction: the top-level `from`
(the literal `cluster` on one side, a path on the other), the `source` block
(a cluster read has one, an artifact comparison does not), and `atRisk` (the
cluster read implies the scan, the artifact comparison does not perform it).
The `source` block is asserted on separately, since a read that matched
nothing produces the same table a broken artifact read would and two
degenerate reads must not agree their way to a pass.

One row is excused, on the Argo CD lanes only. The cluster read takes an
Argo CD chart version from what a sync established, never from the pin, and
on KWOK some Applications never establish one: their sync operation waits on
a health state the simulator does not produce. Such a component reads as
`unversioned` with no `from`. The lane lists the Applications before the
read, and a component may take that row shape only when its Application is
neither `Synced` nor has a completed sync in `status.history`, and only when
it is on `READBACK_UNSETTLED_ALLOWLIST` in `upgrade-readback.sh`: components
observed to stall on KWOK, kai-scheduler today. Any other unsettled
Application fails, so a lane cannot pass having compared nothing. Every other
difference for an allowlisted component still fails, each excused row is
logged, and the list is kept as `excused-unsettled.txt` beside the reports.

Both invocations pass `--fail-on-error=false`: the question is whether the
two paths agree, not whether the upgrade is safe, so a verdict-driven
non-zero exit must not stand in for the comparison. A non-zero exit with
that flag set is a real failure of the command.

On a mismatch the lane prints a unified diff of the two projections and
leaves both reports under `/tmp/kwok-debug-artifacts/upgrade-check/<recipe>-<deployer>/`,
which the composite action uploads. The comparison itself lives in
`kwok/scripts/lib/upgrade-readback.sh` and is unit-tested against fixture
reports by `upgrade-readback_test.sh`; the matrix-deployer to `--deployer`
mapping (`argocd-git` → `argocd`, `argocd-helm-oci` → `argocd-helm`) lives
once in `kwok/scripts/lib/deployer-map.sh`.

Readiness is deliberately not a precondition, so KWOK never producing a
Ready workload cannot affect it. The read needs release records to exist,
which the deploy step has already established: Helm writes its storage
record before any pod runs, the Argo CD gate asserts the root Application
reached `operationState.phase==Succeeded` (so every child Application is
materialized), and the Flux gate asserts every HelmRelease reached
`deployed`.

### Running KWOK Locally

```bash
unset GITLAB_TOKEN
make build
make kwok-cluster

# Single recipe + single deployer
make kwok-test-deployer RECIPE=eks-training DEPLOYER=argocd-oci
```

Valid `DEPLOYER` values: `helm`, `argocd-oci`, `argocd-helm-oci`,
`argocd-git`, `flux-oci`, `flux-git`. The target invokes
`kwok/scripts/run-all-recipes.sh --deployer <name> <recipe>`, which
calls `install-infra.sh` once with `DEPLOYER` exported (in-cluster
`registry:2` always; Argo CD for `argocd-*`; Flux 2 controllers for
`flux-*`; Gitea additionally for the Git-source lanes `flux-git` and
`argocd-git`), then runs `validate-scheduling.sh` for the recipe.

**Registry host port.** The Kind cluster exposes the in-cluster
`registry:2` Service on **host port 5500** (`kwok/kind-config.yaml`'s
`extraPortMappings`). 5500 avoids Apple ControlCenter
(AirPlay / Handoff) which listens on host port 5000 by default on
macOS. Linux runners have 5500 free too. The in-cluster NodePort
(`30500`) and Service `containerPort` (`5000`) are hardcoded and
independent — Argo CD's repo-server reaches the registry via Service
DNS (`registry.aicr-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000`) regardless.

**Gitea host port (flux-git / argocd-git).** The same pattern exposes
the in-cluster Gitea on **host port 3300** (NodePort `30300`) so the
runner can `git push` the filesystem bundle; 3300 avoids Gitea's
default 3000, commonly held by Grafana / local dev servers. The GitOps
controller (Flux's source-controller or Argo CD's repo-server) clones
via Service DNS (`gitea.aicr-registry.svc.cluster.local:3000`).
Clusters created before the 3300 mapping existed must be recreated
(`kind delete cluster --name aicr-kwok-test`) — `install-infra.sh`
exit code 71 is the telltale.

**Sweeping all deployers locally.** `make kwok-test-all` defaults to
`helm`; there is no matrix-aware make target. Loop in shell:

```bash
for d in helm argocd-oci argocd-helm-oci argocd-git flux-oci flux-git; do
  make kwok-test-deployer RECIPE=eks-training DEPLOYER="$d" || break
done

# Full recipe set under a single deployer:
bash kwok/scripts/run-all-recipes.sh --deployer argocd-oci
```

### Failure Modes and Exit Codes

The three scripts emit distinct exit codes so CI, the Make target,
and local loops can branch on failure mode without parsing logs.

| Script | Code | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `install-infra.sh` | 10 | `yq` missing or `.settings.yaml` field absent |
| `install-infra.sh` | 20 | Registry Deployment not Ready within 120 s |
| `install-infra.sh` | 21 | Registry not reachable on host port within 60 s |
| `install-infra.sh` | 30 | Argo CD Helm install failed |
| `install-infra.sh` | 31 | `applications.argoproj.io` CRD not Established within 120 s |
| `install-infra.sh` | 32 | Patching `argocd-cm` with the CSIDriver diff customization failed |
| `install-infra.sh` | 40 | Repository secret apply failed |
| `install-infra.sh` | 60 | Flux install manifest apply failed |
| `install-infra.sh` | 61 | Flux controller not Ready within 180 s |
| `install-infra.sh` | 62 | Flux CRDs not Established within 60 s |
| `install-infra.sh` | 70 | Gitea Deployment not Ready within 120 s |
| `install-infra.sh` | 71 | Gitea not reachable on host port within 60 s (cluster likely predates the 3300 port mapping) |
| `install-infra.sh` | 72 | Gitea admin user bootstrap failed |
| `validate-scheduling.sh` | 50 | GitOps sync deadline hit |
| `run-all-recipes.sh` | 50 | Three consecutive GitOps sync timeouts; ADR-008 3-strike rule tripped |

Exit code 50 is distinct so the 3-strike rule in `run-all-recipes.sh`
counts only sync-deadline strikes, not bundle-render or
scheduling-shape failures.

### Tuning the Sync Deadline

Five environment variables shape how long the GitOps lanes wait
before declaring a sync timeout. Argo CD and Flux pairs are
independent.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `KWOK_ARGOCD_SYNC_TIMEOUT` | `480` s | Deadline for all child Argo CD Applications to reach `Synced+Healthy` |
| `KWOK_ARGOCD_ROOT_GRACE` | `30` s | Grace period for the root Application before deadline counting starts |
| `KWOK_FLUX_SYNC_TIMEOUT` | `500` s | Deadline for source fetch (OCIRepository or GitRepository) + Kustomization apply + HelmReleases `Ready=True` + ArtifactGenerators Ready |
| `KWOK_FLUX_ROOT_GRACE` | `30` s | Grace period for the outer Kustomization before deadline counting starts |
| `KWOK_SYNC_DEADLINE_EPOCH` | unset | Absolute epoch deadline for sync-gate work (CI only). When set, each gate budget becomes min(default, deadline − now); below a 120 s floor the gate fails fast with exit 50 so chainsaw's catch-block diagnostics always print before GitHub's job timeout |

In CI, the `kwok-test` action derives `KWOK_SYNC_DEADLINE_EPOCH` in its
first step — before toolchain setup and the `aicr` build, so the anchor
sits within ~60 s of job start — from its `job_timeout_minutes` input
(required, no default — every caller must wire its own value, which
must equal that caller's `timeout-minutes`; currently `20` for the
KWOK jobs) minus a 240 s margin reserved for chainsaw catch-block
diagnostics, pod verification, and debug-artifact upload. The input
must be a positive integer with no leading zeros, and must leave at
least 120 s of usable budget after the 240 s margin (i.e. `>= 6`); the
step fails fast otherwise. Local runs leave it unset and keep the
fixed defaults above.

The Git-source lanes (`flux-git`, `argocd-git`) additionally honor
`KWOK_GITEA_HOST_PORT` (default `3300`), `KWOK_GITEA_USER` (default
`aicr`), and `KWOK_GITEA_PASSWORD` (default `aicr-kwok-ci`) — shared
between `install-infra.sh` (Gitea install + admin bootstrap) and
`validate-scheduling.sh` (`git push`). The password is a CI-only
credential for the ephemeral in-cluster Gitea, not a secret.
`argocd-git` reuses the `KWOK_ARGOCD_SYNC_TIMEOUT` budget.

On a clean local Kind cluster `Synced+Healthy` lands in ~30 s; the
480-second default exists to absorb CI variance (the all-semantics gate
waits for every Application, not just the first one, so it needs more
budget than the old exists-semantics check did). If a local run trips
code 50 but the cluster is otherwise healthy, raise the relevant
timeout before assuming the recipe is broken — cold-cluster image
pulls are the most common cause.

### Debugging CI Failures

When `kwok-test` fails, it uploads an artifact named
`kwok-debug-<recipe>-<deployer>-<run_id>` containing:

- `<cluster>-resources.txt`, `<cluster>-nodes.txt`, `<cluster>-pods.txt`, `<cluster>-events.txt`
- `<cluster>-argo-apps.yaml` plus the repo-server and application-controller logs (argocd lanes)
- `<cluster>-flux-resources.yaml` (OCIRepositories, GitRepositories, Kustomizations, HelmReleases, ArtifactGenerators, ExternalArtifacts) plus source-, kustomize-, and helm-controller logs (flux-* lanes)
- `<cluster>-registry.log` — last 200 lines of the in-cluster `registry:2`
- `<cluster>-gitea.log` — last 200 lines of the in-cluster Gitea (Git-source lanes: `flux-git`, `argocd-git`)

Start with the repo-server log (Argo CD) or source-controller log
(Flux) for OCI-pull failures. Application-controller / kustomize-controller
logs show reconciliation decisions and prune behavior;
helm-controller logs surface per-`HelmRelease` install outcomes.

Independently of the outcome, every `kwok-test` job also uploads
`kwok-results-<recipe>-<deployer>-<run_id>-<attempt>` containing `kwok-results.json`,
a [CTRF](https://ctrf.io) report written by `run-all-recipes.sh` (via the
shared `tools/ctrf` emitter) with one test per `(recipe, deployer)` cell:
`kwok/<recipe>/<deployer>` with status `passed`, `failed` (the message
distinguishes a GitOps sync timeout from a generic failure), or `skipped`
(no KWOK profile in implicit batch mode). The file is also written on the
3-strike bail, so a truncated matrix still reports the cells it ran, and when
cluster or `install-infra.sh` setup fails before any cell runs it holds a
single `kwok/setup/<deployer>` entry with status `other` and the setup
failure in its message. The report is flushed after every cell, and a TERM
or INT while a cell runs records that cell as `other` ("interrupted") before
the runner exits with the usual 128+signal status, so an interrupted matrix
still reports what it completed.
Locally the same file lands at `/tmp/kwok-debug-artifacts/kwok-results.json`
(override with `KWOK_RESULTS_FILE`).

### Adding a New Deployer Value

The deployer set is finite and matches what `pkg/bundler` emits. To
add a new value:

1. Add a `case` branch in `kwok/scripts/validate-scheduling.sh`'s
   `resolve_argocd_root_app()` (or `resolve_flux_root_names()` for
   Flux-reconciled lanes), plus branches in `generate_bundle` and
   `deploy_bundle`. Reuse the existing `argocd-oci` / `argocd-git` /
   `flux-oci` / `flux-git` branches as templates. For a Git-source lane,
   `argocd-git` and `flux-git` are the closest models — they share the
   `compute_gitea_urls()` / `push_bundle_to_gitea()` helpers (Gitea
   dual-view URLs, push-to-create, branch `main`).
2. Extend the `DEPLOYER` allowlist in
   `kwok/scripts/run-all-recipes.sh` (`case "$DEPLOYER" in` in `main()`).
3. Extend the `case "${DEPLOYER}"` branches in `install-infra.sh`'s
   `main()` so the right controller stack is installed (a Git-source
   lane composes its GitOps controller install with `install_gitea`,
   as `argocd-git` and `flux-git` do).
4. Extend the `deployer:` input description in
   `.github/actions/kwok-test/action.yml`.
5. Add the value to the `deployer:` matrix in Tier 1 and Tier 3 of
   `.github/workflows/kwok-recipes.yaml`. Leave Tier 2 alone — the
   orthogonality rationale above still applies.
6. Add a row to the [Deployer Coverage Matrix](#deployer-coverage-matrix)
   above so contributors can discover the new lane.

If the new value requires changes to in-cluster infra (different
registry, different Argo CD chart, additional CRDs), update
`install-infra.sh` and pin any new versions in `.settings.yaml`. The
exit-code taxonomy in [Failure Modes and Exit Codes](#failure-modes-and-exit-codes)
is contiguous — pick the next free code if a new distinct failure
mode appears.

## E2E Tests

`./tools/e2e` is the CLI integration runner. It builds the `aicr` binary
with goreleaser, then runs the Chainsaw suites in `tests/chainsaw/cli/`,
`tests/chainsaw/signing/`, and `tests/chainsaw/bundle-templates/` with
`--no-cluster`. Each test invokes the binary and asserts on its exit code
and output files; no cluster or cloud account is involved.

```bash
unset GITLAB_TOKEN
./tools/e2e
```

`make qualify` invokes the e2e step (`make e2e`) as part of the pre-push
gate. Locally, suites labelled `ci=true` (they need a CI-attested binary)
are skipped, and suites labelled `requires=docker` are skipped when no
Docker daemon or registry image is available. CI runs the CLI and signing
suites in the `CLI E2E` job of `qualification.yaml`. Testing on real GPU
clusters is covered by [UAT](uat.md).

## The `make qualify` Gate

`make qualify` is the canonical pre-push command. It runs:

- `test-coverage` — `go test -race ./...` plus the 83% coverage floor.
- `lint` — golangci-lint with `.golangci.yaml`, yamllint, and the docs checks
  (filenames, MDX patterns, MDX parse, YAML fences — see
  [Docs MDX Gate](#docs-mdx-gate) and
  [Docs YAML Fence Gate](#docs-yaml-fence-gate)).
- `tuning-check` — node-tuning profile freshness.
- `coverage-check` — the committed CUJ/CLI coverage matrix against the tree.
- `e2e` — the Chainsaw CLI suites via `tools/e2e` (see [E2E Tests](#e2e-tests)).
- `scan` — Grype vulnerability scan.
- `license-check` — license header / dependency-license sweep.
- bundle layout — `TestBundleLayoutMatchesManifest` renders the frozen fixture
  recipe through every deployer and compares the tree to
  `pkg/bundler/testdata/layout/manifests/`. A removed or renamed path fails; an
  added one is additive. See
  [Bundle layout](../user/bundling.md#bundle-layout).
- artifact schemas — `tools/schemagen` tests gate freshness, real-artifact
  validity, and breaking changes against `api/aicr/v1/schemas/baseline/`. See
  [API server](api-server.md#artifact-schema-gate).
- `openapi-diff` — the REST contract in `api/aicr/v1/server.yaml` against its
  committed baseline, failing on unacknowledged breaking changes and on stale
  acknowledgements. See [API server](api-server.md#rest-contract-gate).
- `api-diff` — exported `pkg/client/v1` compatibility, including the scoped
  repository-local type closure reachable through transparent aliases, against
  the latest stable release.

CI runs the equivalent, plus a few checks that exist only there — the lychee
link check on `docs/**`, CodeQL, and the GPU test lanes — so a green local
`make qualify` makes CI likely to pass, not certain.

**Branch lint gate for Go changes.** If a PR changes any `.go` file,
you must also run:

```bash
golangci-lint run -c .golangci.yaml ./pkg/<affected>/...
golangci-lint run -c .golangci.yaml ./...           # full sweep
```

This applies even to PRs labeled `area/docs` when they include
incidental Go changes. Do not rely on CI to surface lint failures —
the pre-push gate is local.

## Docs MDX Gate

Fern renders published docs through an MDX parser, so a construct that is valid
CommonMark can still abort `fern generate --docs` at publish time. A bare `<=`
in prose is the classic case — MDX reads the `<` as the start of a JSX tag and
fails with `Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name`.

**Which files are checked.** Both checks derive their file list from
`docs/index.yml` via `tools/docs-published-files` — Fern's navigation manifest
is the authoritative statement of what gets parsed. Globbing
`docs/user`/`docs/integrator`/`docs/contributor` instead was a denylist in
disguise: it missed `docs/README.md`, the published landing page, so a hazard
there passed both gates and still broke the publish. Add a page to
`docs/index.yml` and it is gated that day; a file that is not published is not
gated at all.

Two checks cover this, both run by `make lint`:

| Check | What it is | Speed |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `make check-docs-mdx` | Pattern-based bash approximation. Names the specific hazard, needs no dependencies. | Instant |
| `make check-docs-mdx-parse` | The real MDX parser (`@mdx-js/mdx`, locked in `tools/mdx/package-lock.json`). Authoritative. | ~2 s + one `npm ci` |

The parser is the source of truth. The bash rules are deliberately kept as a
strict **subset** of what it rejects: a miss is caught by the parse gate, but a
false positive would force you to mangle prose the publish step would have
accepted. That is why `< 500` and `< 10 s` are fine (MDX only enters tag mode
when a name-ish character follows `<` immediately) while `<= 2,000` and `<30 s`
are not.

Hazards only the parser sees: a stray closing tag (`</div>`), an unclosed
fragment (`<>`), a placeholder sharing a line with well-formed JSX, unbalanced
expression braces spanning lines, and any acorn-level syntax error.

Well-formed JSX is fine in both — `<Component />` and `<span>text</span>` parse,
and the Fern component set is authored that way. So is YAML frontmatter: Fern
strips it before MDX, so a `title: gate <= 2,000` is valid, and both checks skip
it by line number so later diagnostics still cite the true line.

`check-docs-mdx-parse` needs Node 20+. Without it the script prints a warning
and exits 0 locally, but **hard-fails under CI** — the `docs-mdx` job in
`merge-gate.yaml` blocks on it, and that workflow's `gate` job is a
required status check. This is the one place where a green local `make qualify` does not
guarantee a green CI: if you have no Node, the MDX gate did not actually run.

Fixing a violation is usually one of:

```markdown
gate <= 2,000   →  gate `<= 2,000`
<30 s           →  `<30 s`        or  &lt;30 s
<br>            →  <br />
{template}      →  \{template\}
```

Note that `fern check` (the Fern Docs CI job) does **not** parse MDX, and the
job that does — `fern generate --docs --preview` — runs as a `workflow_run`
companion whose status never lands on the PR head SHA, so it cannot be a
required check. `make check-docs-mdx-parse` exists to close that gap without a
token or a dependency on Fern's service at merge time.

## Docs YAML Fence Gate

`make check-docs-yaml` checks every Markdown and MDX file under `docs/**`. Any
fenced code block labelled `yaml` or `yml` must parse as YAML. This is a syntax
check only: partial fragments are allowed and do not need to be complete
Kubernetes resources.

Inside a YAML fence, `...` is an explicit document-end marker. Content after it
must start a new document with `---`; use `# ...` to show omitted content.
Aliases must refer to an earlier anchor in the same YAML document. Empty
fragments are valid, but malformed or incomplete YAML directives are rejected.
Fences inside HTML or MDX comments are ignored.

There is no `no-parse` bypass: `yaml no-parse` remains checked, and
comma-suffixed labels such as `yaml,no-parse` are rejected. Relabel Helm or
Go-template examples as `gotemplate`, and intentionally invalid examples as
`text`. The checker needs Node 20+; without Node it warns and skips locally, but
hard-fails in CI so the docs-only merge gate cannot pass without running it.

## Common Gotchas

- **`goreleaser` fails when both `GITLAB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  are set.** `make build`, `make qualify`, and `./tools/e2e` all
  invoke goreleaser indirectly. Always `unset GITLAB_TOKEN` in the
  shell first. This is one of the most common local-only CI-passes-fine
  failure modes.
- **Forgetting `make bom-docs`** after a `recipes/registry.yaml`,
  component values, or chart-pin change. The BOM's **version column
  and component set are now gated**: `TestCommittedBOMVersionsMatchRegistry`
  (run by `make test` → `make qualify`, and by the `bom-freshness`
  merge-gate job on docs-only PRs) fails CI if a pinned version drifts
  or a component row is missing/orphaned. What is **not** gated at PR
  time is *rendered-image drift* — a chart bumping an image inside its
  own templates with no pin change on our side; `make bom-check` (a full
  re-render comparison) is its **opt-in** blocking check, and the weekly
  BOM-refresh workflow auto-detects it and opens a PR. So run
  `make bom-docs` locally any time the change touches charts.
- **Assuming `make notices` is needed** after a `go.mod` or `go.sum` change.
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is the union of every redistributed
  dependency's license across the released OS/arch matrix
  (linux+darwin × amd64+arm64), so a dependency-graph change can add or
  drop entries. The file is not committed — `make release` regenerates it
  from the tag being released and goreleaser uploads it — so there is
  nothing to keep fresh and nothing to remember after a dependency bump.
  The `notices-generator` merge-gate job runs the generator on dependency
  changes and fails CI if it cannot complete, so a break surfaces on the
  PR that causes it instead of blocking a release at tag time.
- **Forgetting `make python-licenses`** after editing
  `validators/performance/requirements.txt`. The notices file also covers
  the Python closure installed into the `aiperf-bench` image, but that
  closure is fetched from PyPI at image-build time and is not part of the
  Go dependency graph, so `make notices` cannot regenerate it.
  `make python-licenses`
  (needs network) refreshes the committed fragment at
  `validators/performance/licenses/python-notices.md`; `make notices`
  then folds it in. The fragment records the sha256 of the requirements
  file it came from, and `make notices` fails closed when that no longer
  matches, so any edit without a refresh is caught by the same
  `notices-generator` job rather than shipping stale attributions.
  The generator sets a fixed platform matrix and `LC_ALL=C`, so
  `make notices` produces byte-identical output on macOS and Linux.
- **Coverage decrease > 0.5%** is flagged for justification (the project-wide
  83% floor is what blocks). Add tests rather than
  reaching for `// nolint` or `t.Skip` — both are review-blockers
  under the no-skip-tests rule in CLAUDE.md.
- **Live-cluster connections from unit tests.** A test that forgets
  `--no-cluster` will attach to whichever kubeconfig is current and
  create RBAC against it. Always pass `WithNoCluster(true)` (Go) or
  `--no-cluster` (CLI / chainsaw) on the validator path.
- **CLI tests asserting on stdout.** `pkg/cli` writes through
  `cmd.Root().Writer`. A test that captures `os.Stdout` will see
  nothing. Use `cmd.Writer = buf` and assert on `buf.String()`.
