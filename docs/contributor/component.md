# Components

A **component** in AICR is a registry entry pointing to a Helm chart or
Kustomize source that recipes can pull. The catalog lives in
[`recipes/registry.yaml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/recipes/registry.yaml);
per-component default values live under
[`recipes/components/<name>/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/recipes/components).
Overlays bind a component to a cluster shape; bundlers turn that
binding into a deployer-specific artifact.

Most components need **no Go code**. The declarative path is one
registry entry plus a `values.yaml`. The legacy
[`pkg/component/generic.go::ComponentConfig`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/component/generic.go)
is marked `Deprecated` — it is unused in production. The live schema
is [`pkg/recipe/components.go::ComponentConfig`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/recipe/components.go).

For the recipe data model — overlays, mixins, criteria, merge order
— see [recipe.md](recipe.md). This page is the contributor view for
adding or changing components.

## Where Does My Change Go?

| I want to... | Edit | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Make an existing chart or kustomization available to recipes | `recipes/registry.yaml` entry | this page |
| Set default values for the chart | `recipes/components/<name>/values.yaml` | this page |
| Pin a chart version for a specific cluster shape | Recipe overlay in `recipes/overlays/` | [recipe.md](recipe.md) |
| Add a bundle-time validation warning | `registry.yaml` `validations:` block | [validator.md](validator.md#component-validations-bundle-time) |
| Add a chainsaw health check | `registry.yaml` `healthCheck.assertFile` + `recipes/checks/<name>/health-check.yaml` | [validator.md](validator.md) |
| Adjust where node selectors land in chart values | `registry.yaml` `nodeScheduling` paths | this page |

## Helm vs Kustomize

A component declares **either** `helm:` **or** `kustomize:` — never
both. `ComponentRegistry.Validate` rejects the mixed shape at load.

| Use `helm:` when | Use `kustomize:` when |
|---|---|
| Upstream ships a published Helm chart | Upstream ships only a Git source with `kustomization.yaml` |
| You need `--set` value overrides | You can accept no `--set` support |
| You want `nodeScheduling` injection | You will configure scheduling out-of-band (Kustomize ignores Helm value paths) |

Kustomize limitations to know up front:

- `--set <key>:<path>=<value>` flows through Helm value rendering only; Kustomize components silently ignore overrides.
- `nodeScheduling.system` / `accelerated` paths target Helm values; they do not apply to Kustomize sources.
- The bundler runs `kustomize build` at bundle time and wraps the output as `templates/manifest.yaml` inside the standard local-format folder (see [index.md](index.md) for the classification rule).

## Adding a Helm Component

**1. Add the registry entry** to `recipes/registry.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: my-operator
  displayName: My Operator
  valueOverrideKeys:
    - myoperator
  helm:
    defaultRepository: https://charts.example.com
    defaultChart: example/my-operator
    defaultVersion: v1.0.0
    defaultNamespace: my-operator
  nodeScheduling:
    system:
      nodeSelectorPaths: [operator.nodeSelector]
      tolerationPaths:   [operator.tolerations]
```

**2. Create `recipes/components/my-operator/values.yaml`** with the
chart defaults you want every recipe to start from. Keep this file
minimal and widely applicable — cluster-specific tweaks belong in
`values-<context>.yaml` siblings referenced from an overlay.

```yaml
# fullnameOverride avoids the aicr-stack- prefix on resource names.
fullnameOverride: my-operator

operator:
  replicas: 1
```

**3. Optional blocks** on the registry entry:

- `validations:` — bundle-time misconfiguration warnings ([validator.md](validator.md#component-validations-bundle-time))
- `healthCheck.assertFile:` — chainsaw conformance assertions ([validator.md](validator.md))
- `manifestFiles:` — manifest YAMLs (paths relative to the recipes data
  root) bundled with the component whenever a recipe references it and the
  componentRef declares none; shipped in the injected `-post` local chart
  after the main release. Ref-declared lists take precedence.
- `storageClassPaths:` — where `--storage-class` is injected
- `sharedStorageClassPaths:` — where `--shared-storage-class` is injected
- `podScheduling.workload.workloadSelectorPaths` — for workload-pod placement
- `gkeCriticalPriority`, `hasSelfRefCRDs`, `manifestsUseChartCRDs` — narrow service-specific quirks (see godoc on `ComponentConfig` for when these apply)

**4. Run `make bom-docs`** and commit the regenerated
`docs/user/container-images.md` in the same PR. CLAUDE.md treats this
as a hard rule whenever you change `registry.yaml`, a component's
`values.yaml`, or any chart version pin. See [BOM regeneration](#bom-regeneration).

**5. Run `make qualify`** — covers tests, lint, and the recipe-resolution
suite that parses every registry entry.

## Adding a Kustomize Component

```yaml
- name: my-kustomize-app
  displayName: My Kustomize App
  valueOverrideKeys:
    - mykustomize
  kustomize:
    defaultSource: https://github.com/example/my-app
    defaultPath: deploy/production
    defaultTag: v1.0.0
```

No `recipes/components/<name>/values.yaml` is required — Kustomize
reads its inputs from the upstream source. Reminder: no `--set`
overrides, and `nodeScheduling` paths do not apply.

## Schema Reference

Authoritative definitions live in
[`pkg/recipe/components.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/recipe/components.go).
One-liner per field:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name` | Component identifier; must match `componentRefs[].name` in overlays |
| `displayName` | Human-readable label used in CLI output and bundle templates |
| `valueOverrideKeys` | Alt prefixes for `--set <key>:path=value` matching |
| `helm.defaultRepository` | Helm repo URL injected when an overlay leaves it empty |
| `helm.defaultChart` | Chart name (e.g. `nvidia/gpu-operator`) |
| `helm.defaultVersion` | Default chart version |
| `helm.defaultNamespace` | Install namespace |
| `kustomize.defaultSource` | Git or OCI source URL |
| `kustomize.defaultPath` | Subpath within the source |
| `kustomize.defaultTag` | Git ref / OCI tag |
| `nodeScheduling.system` | Helm value paths that receive the **control-plane** node selector / tolerations / taints |
| `nodeScheduling.accelerated` | Helm value paths that receive the **GPU node** selector / tolerations / taints |
| `nodeScheduling.nodeCountPaths` | Where `--nodes` is written |
| `podScheduling.workload.workloadSelectorPaths` | Workload-pod placement |
| `storageClassPaths` | Where `--storage-class` is written |
| `sharedStorageClassPaths` | Where `--shared-storage-class` is written for shared filesystem PVCs |
| `validations` | Bundle-time component check list ([validator.md](validator.md#component-validations-bundle-time)) |
| `healthCheck.assertFile` | Chainsaw assert YAML path (relative to data dir) |
| `manifestFiles` | Default manifest YAML paths bundled when the componentRef declares none (ref-declared lists take precedence). No opt-out: an empty ref-declared list is indistinguishable from absent (len == 0 → defaults filled) — to suppress the defaults, declare a replacement list. Helm components only; the loader rejects the combination with `kustomize:` |
| `gkeCriticalPriority`, `hasSelfRefCRDs`, `manifestsUseChartCRDs` | Narrow service-specific flags (see godoc) |

## `nodeScheduling.system` vs `accelerated`

This is the field most contributors get wrong on first PR.

- `system` — paths into chart values for workloads that must land on
  **management / control-plane nodes** (e.g., operators, controllers,
  webhooks). The bundler writes the `--system-node-selector` and
  `--system-node-toleration` values here.
- `accelerated` — paths into chart values for workloads that must
  land on **GPU nodes** (e.g., device-plugin DaemonSets,
  driver-validation, DCGM exporters). The bundler writes the
  `--accelerated-node-selector` and `--accelerated-node-toleration`
  values here.

Concrete example from `gpu-operator`:

```yaml
nodeScheduling:
  system:
    nodeSelectorPaths:
      - operator.nodeSelector
      - node-feature-discovery.master.nodeSelector
    tolerationPaths:
      - operator.tolerations
  accelerated:
    nodeSelectorPaths:
      - daemonsets.nodeSelector
      - node-feature-discovery.worker.nodeSelector
    tolerationPaths:
      - daemonsets.tolerations
```

Wrong column = workloads land on the wrong node class. A DaemonSet
placed under `system` will miss GPU nodes; an operator under
`accelerated` will refuse to schedule on a cluster with tainted GPU
nodes only.

## `valueOverrideKeys`

`--set <key>:<path>=<value>` matches via `GetByOverrideKey`:

1. The component `name` is checked first.
2. Each entry in `valueOverrideKeys` is then checked.

For `gpu-operator` with `valueOverrideKeys: [gpuoperator]`, both
`--set gpu-operator:driver.version=...` and
`--set gpuoperator:driver.version=...` resolve to the same component.
Pick a key that is easier to type (no hyphens) and document it in the
displayName-adjacent comments if non-obvious. Override keys are
globally unique — `ComponentRegistry.Validate` rejects duplicates.

## Exposing Scheduling Knobs Without New Flags

A recurring first-PR instinct is to add a new CLI flag for every
placement knob a chart exposes — one flag for the controller, one for
the workers, one for a sidecar, and so on. Don't. AICR already models
node placement as **value paths**, not flags, so the existing
primitives cover arbitrary chart depth without growing the CLI surface.

Two separate mechanisms are at work — keep them distinct:

**Path routing.** `nodeScheduling` is registry metadata that maps chart
value paths onto the `system` / `accelerated` node classes (see
[the section above](#nodeschedulingsystem-vs-accelerated)). It selects
*which* chart paths receive a node selector / toleration; it does not
participate in value precedence. The bundler fans `--system-node-selector`
/ `--accelerated-node-selector` (and the matching `*-toleration` flags)
out to **every** declared path, so one flag covers N workloads.

**Value precedence.** Once a path is targeted, its value is resolved
across layers, lowest precedence first:

1. **Component value defaults** — ship sane defaults in
   `recipes/components/<name>/values.yaml`, or per-recipe in an overlay
   `componentRefs[].valuesFile` / inline `overrides`. This is where the
   common case (e.g. a managed cluster's standard node labels) works
   out of the box with no flags at all.
2. **Deploy-time overrides** — `--set <key>:<path>=<value>` reaches any
   value path for last-mile deviations; `--dynamic <key>:<path>` defers
   a path to install time (it is stripped from `values.yaml` into
   `cluster-values.yaml` for the operator to fill in).

Merge order is base → `valuesFile` → overlay `overrides` →
`--set` / `--dynamic`, so a bundle-time override always wins over a
recipe default. The node-class flags (`--system-node-selector` et al.)
write into their routed paths at bundle time, alongside `--set`.

The narrow exception is a **bundler-owned derived integration value**:
when AICR renders both sides of a cross-chart contract and allowing either
side to drift would produce an invalid bundle, the bundler may enforce that
contract after ordinary overrides. The DRA/GPU Operator integration is the
worked example: AICR merges the configured DRA eviction label into
`kubeletPlugin.nodeSelector` and writes the same label key to GPU Operator's
`NODE_LABEL_FOR_GPU_POD_EVICTION`. This exception must remain gated on both
components being enabled, must reject dynamic declarations that could move
either managed path to install-time configuration, and must be covered across
every deployer. Ordinary workload placement still uses registry paths and must
not grow a special flag.

**Deciding where a knob belongs:**

| Situation | Where it goes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Workload must run on management / control-plane nodes | Path under `nodeScheduling.system` | Inherits `--system-node-selector` automatically |
| Workload must run on GPU nodes | Path under `nodeScheduling.accelerated` | Inherits `--accelerated-node-selector` automatically |
| A pool that is neither (e.g. a dedicated CPU-worker pool) | Leave it out of `nodeScheduling`; target via `--set <key>:that.path.nodeSelector.<label>=<value>` | The two-class model intentionally covers only system vs GPU; everything else is reachable by path |
| Value is cluster-specific and unknown at bundle time | `--dynamic <key>:<path>` | Lands in `cluster-values.yaml` for install-time entry |

"When omitted, inherit from the node class" needs no special logic — a
path listed under `system` / `accelerated` **is** the inheritance.

**Caveat: the chart must actually render the path.** A `nodeSelector`
path only takes effect if the upstream chart template renders it. Some
charts honor only `affinity` / `tolerations` and silently drop
`nodeSelector`, so a declared path becomes a no-op. Verify against the
chart's templates before adding a path. If the chart does not support
it, either pin placement through the `affinity` path the chart *does*
render (as a `values.yaml` default) or omit the path and document the
limitation in a registry comment. The `slinky-slurm-operator` entry in
[`registry.yaml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/recipes/registry.yaml)
is a worked example of the latter.

## `deploymentOrder`

`RecipeResult.DeploymentOrder` is **derived**, not authored.
`TopologicalSort` in `pkg/recipe/metadata_store.go` orders components
by `componentRefs[].dependencyRefs` declared in the overlay. When no
dependencies are declared, the order falls back to the order in
which components are listed in the overlay's `componentRefs`. Express
ordering by declaring `dependencyRefs` on the dependent component, not
by writing a separate `deploymentOrder` block.

## Local Format and Bundle Classification

The bundler emits a uniform `NNN-<component>/` layout via
[`pkg/bundler/deployer/localformat`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/pkg/bundler/deployer/localformat).
Classification (single source of truth in `localformat.classify`):

| Recipe shape | Folder kind |
|---|---|
| `helm.defaultRepository` set, no `manifestFiles` | `KindUpstreamHelm` |
| `helm.defaultRepository` set + `manifestFiles` | `KindUpstreamHelm` + `KindLocalHelm` (`-post` injected) |
| `helm.defaultRepository == ""` + `manifestFiles` | `KindLocalHelm` |
| `kustomize.*Tag` or `*Path` set | `KindLocalHelm` (`kustomize build` → `templates/manifest.yaml`) |

If both `helm` and `kustomize` fields are populated, `Validate`
rejects the registry entry — there is no precedence rule because the
shape is invalid. `manifestFiles` are added post-chart; `preManifestFiles`
ship at sync-wave N-1 (e.g., a Namespace with PSS labels the chart
pods depend on).

## Deployers

AICR ships five output adapters in
[`pkg/bundler/deployer/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/pkg/bundler/deployer):
`helm`, `helmfile`, `argocd`, `argocd-helm`, `flux`. Each calls
`localformat.Write()` and then layers its own orchestration files
(`deploy.sh`, `helmfile.yaml`, Argo `Application` CRs, Flux
`HelmRelease`s). **Components do not need to be deployer-aware** —
the bundler renders per-deployer from one component definition.

### Deployment ordering

**One model, three projections.** Every deployer derives ordering from
the same source: each component's declared `dependencyRefs`. What
differs is how faithfully a deployer's native mechanism can express
that dependency graph. For the concurrent deployers, components with no
path between them are independent and roll out **concurrently**, while a
real dependency **gates** (the dependent waits for its dependency to be
healthy). The `NNN-<name>/` folder numbers reflect `DeploymentOrder`
(a topological serialization) for readability, and drive the two
deliberately linear paths — the helm `deploy.sh` and `--serial` mode —
which install strictly in that order regardless of tiers.

`pkg/recipe` exposes the graph two ways, and deployers pick whichever
fits their mechanism:

- `TopologicalSort` → a flat `DeploymentOrder` (one valid serialization).
- `ComponentRefsTopologicalLevels` → dependency-depth **tiers**, where a
  tier holds exactly the components whose dependencies are all satisfied
  by earlier tiers (so a tier's members are mutually independent).

**flux — the exact DAG.** Flux's `dependsOn` is a native dependency
graph, so the flux deployer projects each component's declared
`dependencyRefs` directly onto it: a `HelmRelease`'s `dependsOn` names
exactly its dependencies' terminal releases, nothing more. This is the
most faithful and most parallel rendering — a component waits only for
what it actually needs — and it reads naturally to flux users because
`dependsOn` mirrors `dependencyRefs` one-for-one. See `declaredDependsOn`.

**argocd / argocd-helm — tiers as sync-wave bands.** Argo CD's
`sync-wave` is a single integer per Application. Applications sharing a
wave sync together, and Argo advances to a higher wave only once the
current one is healthy — ordered *bands*, a partial order rather than a
total one. Because a component gets one integer, it cannot express "wait
for A but not B" when A and B sit at the same depth, so the DAG is
**approximated** by tiers: `wave = tier*4 + phase`, where the
per-component phase orders `-pre` → primary → `-post` → `-readiness`.
The stride-4 band width keeps consecutive tiers disjoint, so a tier's
readiness gate still blocks the next tier. The cost of the coarser
banding is mild over-constraint (a component waits for its whole prior
tier, not just its own dependencies). See `waveForFolder`.

**helmfile — tiers as sequential sub-helmfiles.** Emits one
`level-N.yaml` sub-helmfile per tier, processed in sequence so each
tier's CRDs land in the cluster's REST mapper before the next tier's
plan is rendered (issue #914). Within a sub-helmfile, `needs:` edges
chain only a component's own `-pre` → primary → `-post` releases;
independent components in the tier carry no edge, so helmfile applies
them concurrently. Cross-tier ordering is the sub-helmfile sequence, not
per-release `needs:` — the same tier approximation as argocd. See
`buildHelmfile`.

**helm — deliberately serial.** The `deploy.sh` installs one component
at a time in `DeploymentOrder`, trading parallelism for the simplest
possible shell. The readiness gates already sequence it correctly.

#### Disabling parallelism (`--serial`)

`aicr bundle --serial` forces every deployer to install components
strictly one at a time in `DeploymentOrder`, an escape hatch for
reproducing the pre-parallelism ordering or bisecting a misbehaving
rollout. It affects the four concurrent deployers: argocd and
argocd-helm fall back to a linear sync-wave per folder, flux chains each
`HelmRelease` `dependsOn` to the previous component instead of
projecting the DAG, and helmfile chains every release to its predecessor
via `needs:` (one linear apply chain) instead of only within a
component. The helm `deploy.sh` is already serial, so the flag is a
no-op for it. Off by default.

See [index.md](index.md#community-standard-deployment-targets) for
the deployer matrix.

## BOM Regeneration

`docs/user/container-images.md` is rendered fresh from each Helm
chart's actual templates by `make bom-docs`. Run it and commit the
regenerated file in the **same PR** whenever you:

- Add or remove a component
- Bump a chart version (in `registry.yaml`, an overlay, or a mixin)
- Change a `values.yaml` in a way that affects which images render
  (image-repo override, subchart enable/disable, etc.)

The BOM's version column and component set are gated at PR time
(`TestCommittedBOMVersionsMatchRegistry` plus the `bom-freshness`
merge-gate job), so a missed regen after a version or component-set
change fails CI. Not gated at PR time is *rendered-image drift* — a
chart pulling a new image with no pin change on our side; `make
bom-check` (a full re-render comparison) is its **opt-in** blocking
check, and the weekly BOM-refresh workflow auto-detects it and opens a
PR. Still run `make bom-docs` locally on any chart-touching change.

## Boundary: Components Are Metadata

A component entry describes *what* to deploy and where its values
land. Components do **not** carry apply, wait, uninstall, rollback,
or readiness-polling logic — those concerns belong to the deployer
that consumes the bundle. If you find yourself writing custom apply
code inside the bundler or under `pkg/component/`, you are on the
wrong side of the boundary — see
[index.md "What AICR Is Not"](index.md#what-aicr-is-not).
