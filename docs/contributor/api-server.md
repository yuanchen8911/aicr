# API Server (`aicrd`)

`aicrd` is a stateless HTTP service that exposes recipe and bundle
generation over REST. It is a thin transport over the
[`pkg/client/v1`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/client/v1)
facade — the same `aicr.Client` the CLI uses. The server owns parsing,
allowlist enforcement, response shape, and middleware; the facade and
downstream packages own everything else.

The boundary is hard. Handlers are **adapters**, not business logic.
Any code under `pkg/server/*_handler.go` that does more than parse →
allowlist-check → call facade → format response is a review-blocker.
See [contributor index](index.md) for the package separation rule and
[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
for the underlying HTTP and error patterns.

For endpoint payload schemas, query parameters, and examples consult:

- [docs/user/api-reference.md](../user/api-reference.md) — user-facing reference
- [`api/aicr/v1/server.yaml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/api/aicr/v1/server.yaml) — canonical OpenAPI spec

This page covers the contributor view: package layout, middleware
ordering, the handler pattern, and the walkthrough for adding an
endpoint.

## Package Layout

All server code lives in [`pkg/server`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/pkg/server).

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `serve.go` | Entry point. Parses env allowlists, constructs `aicr.Client`, wires the v1 and v2 recipe, query, and bundle routes, runs `Server.Run` |
| `server.go` | `Server` struct, options, route mux, lifecycle (`Start`, `Shutdown`, `Run`) |
| `config.go` | `config` struct and env-var overrides (`PORT`, `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) |
| `middleware.go` | 8-layer middleware chain; ordering rationale lives in source comments |
| `recipe_handler.go` | `GET\|POST /v1/recipe`, `/v1/query`, `/v2/recipe`, and `/v2/query` adapter over the profile-aware `Client` resolution methods |
| `bundle_handler.go` | `POST /v1/bundle` and `/v2/bundle` adapter over `Client.AdoptRecipe` + `Client.MakeBundle` |
| `health.go` | `GET /health` and `GET /ready` |
| `metrics.go` | Prometheus collectors (requests, duration, in-flight, rate-limit rejects, panic recoveries) |
| `version.go` | `X-API-Version` header negotiation from `Accept: application/vnd.nvidia.aicr.v1+json` |
| `errors.go` | `WriteError` / `WriteErrorFromErr` — central status mapping and cause-leak rule |
| `allowlist.go` | Handler-level allowlist pre-check (`validateAgainstAllowLists`) |
| `response_writer.go` | Status-capture wrapper so middleware can observe the handler's status code |
| `context.go` | Typed context keys and `RequestIDFromContext` helper |
| `openapi_sync_test.go` | CI gate: criteria-enum and `/v1/bundle` contract drift fails the build |

`cmd/aicrd/main.go` is a one-liner that calls `server.Serve()`.

## Middleware Chain

Composition lives in `withMiddleware` in
[`pkg/server/middleware.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/server/middleware.go).
Order is **outermost first**:

| # | Layer | Purpose |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | `metricsMiddleware` | Start timer, increment in-flight gauge, record duration and status histogram. Outermost so total latency is captured. |
| 2 | `versionMiddleware` | Parse `Accept` for `application/vnd.nvidia.aicr.v<N>+json`; stash version in context; set `X-API-Version` response header |
| 3 | `requestIDMiddleware` | Honor `X-Request-Id` if a valid UUID, else mint one; stash in context; echo to response header |
| 4 | `timeoutMiddleware` | `context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), defaults.ServerHandlerTimeout)` (90s). Bounds every inner layer, including body reads inside the handler. |
| 5 | `loggingMiddleware` | Captures status via `responseWriter`; logs request start (Debug) and completion (Debug/Warn/Error keyed on status class) |
| 6 | `panicRecoveryMiddleware` | `defer recover()` → 500 + `panicRecoveries` counter. Inside logging so the completion line still fires. |
| 7 | `rateLimitMiddleware` | `golang.org/x/time/rate` limiter (default 100 req/s, burst 200). Always emits `X-RateLimit-*` headers, including on the 429 branch. |
| 8 | `bodyLimitMiddleware` | `http.MaxBytesReader(r.Body, defaults.ServerMaxBodyBytes)` (8 MiB). Innermost so a handler installing a tighter cap composes cleanly. |

Ordering invariants (also documented in source):

- **Timeout outside logging.** Logged latency reflects the real deadline.
- **Panic recovery inside logging.** A panic-converted 500 still produces the completion log line.
- **Rate limit outside body limit.** A 429 short-circuits before any body-cap setup.
- **Body limit innermost.** Per-endpoint `http.MaxBytesReader` calls in handlers (recipe = 1 MiB, bundle = 8 MiB) reapply cleanly inside the default cap.

System endpoints — `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics` — bypass the chain
entirely. The `/` root route is added to the handlers map by
`configureRootHandler` (not via `WithHandler`, which installs only
caller-provided handlers) and is then wrapped by the same middleware loop, so
it runs the full chain like application routes.

## Handler Pattern

Every handler is an adapter. The shape, in order:

1. **Method gate.** Reject with 405 and set `Allow:` header. Use `WriteError` with `ErrCodeMethodNotAllowed`.
2. **Per-handler context timeout.** `context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), defaults.RecipeHandlerTimeout)` (30s) or `BundleHandlerTimeout` (60s). All must be ≤ `ServerHandlerTimeout` (90s) or the outer middleware clamps them.
3. **Parse input.** Query parameters via `recipe.ParseCriteriaFromRequest`; bodies via `json.NewDecoder` wrapped in `http.MaxBytesReader` for the per-endpoint cap.
4. **Allowlist pre-check.** `validateAgainstAllowLists(h.allowLists, criteria)` runs the same projection the facade uses (`aicr.ToInternalAllowLists`) so the handler error message and facade backstop never drift.
5. **Call the facade.** `Client.ResolveRecipeFromCriteria`, `Client.AdoptRecipe`, `Client.MakeBundle`. No business logic in the handler itself.
6. **Format the response.** `serializer.RespondJSON` for JSON; stream zip bytes directly for bundle. Set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=<RecipeCacheTTL>` on cacheable GETs.
7. **Errors via `WriteErrorFromErr`.**

### Body bounding

Bodies are bounded twice: defense-in-depth.

```go
// per-endpoint cap applied inside the handler
bounded := http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body, defaults.MaxBundlePOSTBytes)
if err := json.NewDecoder(bounded).Decode(&recipeResult); err != nil {
    var maxBytesErr *http.MaxBytesError
    if stderrors.As(err, &maxBytesErr) {
        WriteError(w, r, http.StatusRequestEntityTooLarge,
            aicrerrors.ErrCodeInvalidRequest, "...", false, ...)
        return
    }
    ...
}
```

| Cap | Value | Where |
|-----|-------|-------|
| `defaults.ServerMaxBodyBytes` | 8 MiB | Default for all routes via `bodyLimitMiddleware` |
| `defaults.MaxRecipePOSTBytes` | 1 MiB | Recipe and query POST bodies |
| `defaults.MaxBundlePOSTBytes` | 8 MiB | Bundle POST bodies |

### Error responses and the 5xx cause-leak rule

All errors flow through
[`WriteErrorFromErr`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/server/errors.go).
It maps a `*errors.StructuredError` to an HTTP status via `httpStatusFromCode`
and serializes the `ErrorResponse` shape (`code`, `message`, `details`,
`requestId`, `timestamp`, `retryable`).

Critical rule, enforced at this single chokepoint:

> Embed `Cause.Error()` in `details["error"]` **only when `status < 500`**.
> 4xx errors typically carry validator feedback the client needs;
> 5xx errors carry internal paths, kubeconfig contents, or upstream
> service hostnames that must not leak.

Handlers must always go through `WriteErrorFromErr` — never construct
an `errorResponse` directly. Bare `fmt.Errorf` or string concatenation
of internal causes into a 500 response body is a review-blocker; the
underlying violation is the
[error-wrapping rule in CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md).

### Allowlists

`aicr.AllowLists` is parsed from environment at startup
(`aicr.ParseAllowListsFromEnv`) and passed to both:

- The `aicr.Client` via `aicr.WithAllowLists(...)`. The facade enforces on `ResolveRecipeFromCriteria` and `MakeBundle`. This is the **backstop**.
- Each handler via `newRecipeHandler(client, allowLists)` / `newBundleHandler(client, allowLists)`. The handler runs an explicit pre-check (`validateAgainstAllowLists`) so the user-facing rejection message stays exact.

Both call sites go through `aicr.ToInternalAllowLists` so a new
field is wired in one place.

## Endpoints

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/` | GET | Lists registered routes (unmatched paths route here via `ServeMux`) |
| `/health` | GET | Liveness — always 200 if the process is running |
| `/ready` | GET | Readiness — 503 with `reason` until `setReady(true)`, 200 after |
| `/metrics` | GET, HEAD | Prometheus exposition (`promhttp.Handler()` behind `readOnly`, which rejects other methods with a structured 405) |
| `/v1/recipe` | GET, POST | Resolve recipe from criteria → `RecipeResult` JSON |
| `/v1/query` | GET, POST | Resolve recipe, hydrate values, return value at `?selector=path` |
| `/v1/bundle` | POST | Adopt `RecipeResult` body, generate bundle, stream zip |
| `/v2/recipe` | GET, POST | Resolve a profile-aware recipe from criteria → strict `RecipeResult` JSON |
| `/v2/query` | GET, POST | Resolve a profile-aware recipe, hydrate values, and return the required selector path |
| `/v2/bundle` | POST | Strictly decode a profile-aware `RecipeResult`, generate a bundle, and stream zip |

Schemas, query parameters, and example payloads live in
[docs/user/api-reference.md](../user/api-reference.md) and
[`api/aicr/v1/server.yaml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/api/aicr/v1/server.yaml).

## Configuration

Environment variables read at startup:

| Variable | Default | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `PORT` | 8080 | `defaults.EnvServerPort` (in `config.go`) |
| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 30 | `defaults.EnvServerShutdownTimeoutSeconds` |
| `AICR_ALLOWED_ACCELERATORS` | unset → unrestricted | `aicr.ParseAllowListsFromEnv` |
| `AICR_ALLOWED_SERVICES` | unset → unrestricted | same |
| `AICR_ALLOWED_INTENTS` | unset → unrestricted | same |
| `AICR_ALLOWED_OS` | unset → unrestricted | same |
| `AICR_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `pkg/logging` |
| `AICR_SIGNING_KEY` | unset → signing off | `parseSigningConfig` (Mode A KMS URI) |
| `AICR_FULCIO_URL` | unset → signing off | `parseSigningConfig` (Mode B private Fulcio) |
| `AICR_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` | unset | `parseSigningConfig` (Mode B token source) |
| `AICR_REKOR_URL` | unset | `parseSigningConfig` (both modes) |
| `AICR_SIGNING_CONFIG_PATH` | unset | `parseSigningConfig` (both modes; Rekor v2) |
| `AICR_TLOG_UPLOAD` | `true` | `parseSigningConfig` (Mode A only) |
| `AICR_BINARY_ATTESTATION_FILE` | unset → `<executable>-attestation.sigstore.json` next to the binary | `resolveBinaryAttestationPath` (override for ko `KO_DATA_PATH` layouts) |
| `AICR_BINARY_ATTESTATION_IDENTITY_REGEXP` | unset → `verifier.TrustedRepositoryPattern` (release `on-tag.yaml`) | `resolveBinaryAttestationIdentityPattern` (must be confined to `NVIDIA/aicr` — begins with the repository prefix, no top-level alternation, and no match against foreign-identity canaries — validated by `verifier.ValidateIdentityPattern`; retargets the attesting NVIDIA workflow, e.g. an e2e build) |

See [Server-Side Bundle Signing](#server-side-bundle-signing) for the identity
model and validation rules behind these variables.

Compiled-time constants live in
[`pkg/defaults`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/pkg/defaults):

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `ServerHandlerTimeout` | 90s (outer middleware) |
| `RecipeHandlerTimeout` | 30s (per-handler ctx) |
| `BundleHandlerTimeout` | 60s (per-handler ctx) |
| `ServerReadTimeout` / `WriteTimeout` / `IdleTimeout` | 10s / 90s / 120s |
| `ServerReadHeaderTimeout` | 5s |
| `ServerMaxHeaderBytes` | 64 KiB |
| `ServerDefaultRateLimit` / `Burst` | 100 rps / 200 |
| `RecipeCacheTTL` | 10m |

Constraint: every per-handler `WithTimeout` must be ≤ `ServerHandlerTimeout`,
and `ServerWriteTimeout` must be ≥ `ServerHandlerTimeout`, else the outer
middleware silently clamps a slow request.

## Server-Side Bundle Signing

`POST /v1/bundle?attest=true` returns a signed bundle. The signing identity is
operator configuration, parsed once at startup by `parseSigningConfig`
([`pkg/server/signing.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/server/signing.go))
into a `signingConfig`. No field on that struct ever comes from a request: the
server always signs as itself, so the request only chooses whether to sign, not
with what. The handler enforces the trust boundary in `resolveAttestRequest`,
rejecting `attest=true` with HTTP 400 when no identity is configured and
rejecting an unparseable `attest` value with HTTP 400.

**Access control is the operator's responsibility.** The signature attests that
this aicrd deployment produced the bundle (build and tool provenance); it does not
endorse the caller-supplied recipe's contents. `/v1/bundle` accepts arbitrary
recipes and is not itself authenticated, so when signing is enabled the endpoint
must be access-controlled by the deployment (network policy, gateway, or mTLS) to
prevent an untrusted caller from obtaining server-signed bundles. Signing is
opt-in and off by default.

**Two mutually exclusive modes.** Mode A is KMS-backed (`AICR_SIGNING_KEY`, a
cosign KMS URI validated against a scheme allowlist). Mode B is keyless against a
private Sigstore (`AICR_FULCIO_URL` plus a token source: `AICR_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`
or GitHub Actions ambient OIDC). `parseSigningConfig` validates mode exclusivity
and completeness and **fails fast**: an ambiguous config (both modes set), a
malformed KMS URI, a partial keyless config, or a non-boolean `AICR_TLOG_UPLOAD`
(parsed only in KMS mode, where the toggle applies) returns an error from `Serve`
so the server does not start. When no signing variables are set, signing is simply
off and the server starts normally.

**Per-request options are rebuilt, not cached.** `signingConfig.resolveOptions`
constructs the per-request `attestation.ResolveOptions`. For Mode B it reads the
identity-token file **fresh** on every call, because ServiceAccount tokens rotate
and Fulcio binds each certificate to a fresh token.

**Binary attestation cached at startup.** Server signing also requires the aicrd
binary's own attestation (tool provenance): a Sigstore bundle shipped next to the
executable inside the container image, issued under the NVIDIA-CI identity and
bound to the binary's digest. `loadBinaryAttestation` verifies it **once** at
startup (`Serve` calls it after `parseSigningConfig`) and caches the raw bytes on
the `signingConfig`; each signed bundle embeds those bytes as
`attestation/aicr-attestation.sigstore.json`. This is fail-fast too: a signing
server that cannot prove its own provenance must not start. Producing that
attestation in CI/release is a separate dependency, tracked outside this feature.

`resolveBinaryAttestationPath` chooses which file to verify: by default the
conventional path next to the executable (`FindBinaryAttestation`), or the
explicit `AICR_BINARY_ATTESTATION_FILE` override when set. The override exists for
ko-built images, whose assets live under `KO_DATA_PATH`
(`/var/run/ko/aicrd-attestation.sigstore.json`) rather than next to the binary.
Only the attestation file path changes; the digest verified against it is always
the running `os.Executable()` binary's digest.

`resolveBinaryAttestationIdentityPattern` chooses the certificate-identity
pattern the attestation is verified against: `verifier.TrustedRepositoryPattern`
(the release `on-tag.yaml` workflow) by default, or the
`AICR_BINARY_ATTESTATION_IDENTITY_REGEXP` override when set. The override is
validated by `verifier.ValidateIdentityPattern`, which requires it to *begin
with* `https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/` (a leading `^` is allowed) and to avoid
top-level alternation, so it can only retarget which NVIDIA workflow attested
the binary (e.g. the server-kms e2e build), never widen the org. Merely
containing `NVIDIA/aicr` is not enough: a pattern that reaches the repository
down one branch and something else down another is rejected. A bad override fails
startup fast. This mirrors the CLI's `--certificate-identity-regexp`, and a
custom pattern is logged because bundles the server then signs will not pass a
verifier using the default identity.

**Injectable seams for tests.** The startup verifier
(`binaryAttestationVerifier`) and the per-request attester builder
(`attesterBuilder`) are function-typed fields so tests can inject fixtures: the
real verifier pins the NVIDIA-CI identity and the running binary's digest, which
a `go test` executable cannot satisfy.

## OpenAPI Parity Test

[`pkg/server/openapi_sync_test.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/server/openapi_sync_test.go)
contains two contract gates:

- `TestOpenAPIEnumsMatchGoTypes` asserts that every criteria-field enum in
  `api/aicr/v1/server.yaml` matches the corresponding
  `pkg/recipe.GetCriteria*Types()` function. It scans both query-parameter enums
  and `components.schemas.Criteria` properties.
- `TestOpenAPIV1BundleRecipeContract` asserts that `/v1/bundle` and its
  deprecated wrapper share the request schema, that both `/v1/recipe` success
  responses still point at the strict `RecipeResponse`, and that the header
  enums on both sides stay synchronized with the Go constants. It matches the
  `allOf` branches by content rather than position, since `allOf` is
  semantically unordered.

  Runtime acceptance of the legacy header shapes is pinned separately by
  `TestBundleHandler_LegacyRecipeHeaders`, which posts absent, empty, and
  `kind: Recipe` bodies to the handler, asserts 200, and round-trips the
  emitted `recipe.yaml` back through the file loader to prove the ingest
  normalization holds. The spec gate alone would only be checking the spec
  against itself.

Drift is a contract bug: clients conforming to the spec will reject
inputs the server actually accepts, or generate types that reject
server outputs. Adding a value to a Go criteria type without updating
the spec — or the reverse — fails CI here.

The wildcard `"any"` is allowed in the spec but not the Go list; the
test strips it before comparison.

## Adding an Endpoint

1. **Edit `api/aicr/v1/server.yaml`.** Add the operation under `paths:`, request and response schemas under `components.schemas`. If the operation accepts criteria, reference `#/components/schemas/Criteria` so the parity test covers it.
2. **Add a facade method.** If new business logic is required, add it to `pkg/client/v1/aicr.go` (or a sibling file in `pkg/client/v1`). The CLI and any external Go caller will use the same method. Handlers must never call into `pkg/recipe`, `pkg/bundler`, etc. directly.
3. **Add the handler.** Create `pkg/server/<name>_handler.go`. Mirror the existing handler shape: method gate, per-handler timeout, parse, allowlist pre-check (if it accepts user input dimensions), bounded body read, facade call, `serializer.RespondJSON` or zip stream, `WriteErrorFromErr` on every error path.
4. **Register the route.** Add an entry to the `map[string]http.HandlerFunc` in `serve.go` (the `WithHandler` argument). The route picks up the full middleware chain automatically.
5. **Wire allowlists if needed.** Pass `allowLists` into the handler constructor and call `validateAgainstAllowLists` before the facade call. Do not invent a parallel allowlist path; reuse `aicr.ToInternalAllowLists`.
6. **Tighten the body cap.** If the endpoint accepts POST bodies and 8 MiB is wrong, define a `defaults.Max<Name>POSTBytes` constant and wrap `r.Body` with `http.MaxBytesReader` inside the handler. Handle `*http.MaxBytesError` explicitly → 413.
7. **Run the contract tests.**
   `go test -run '^(TestOpenAPIEnumsMatchGoTypes|TestOpenAPIV1BundleRecipeContract)$' ./pkg/server/...`.
   Add cases to `openapi_sync_test.go` if you introduced a new enum-bearing
   field or changed the `/v1/bundle` recipe schema.
8. **Update [docs/user/api-reference.md](../user/api-reference.md)** in the same PR. CLAUDE.md's docs-updates-with-behavior-changes rule applies.

The endpoint cannot return business types raw — it must serialize
through `serializer.RespondJSON` (which uses deterministic encoding)
or stream binary content directly. Returning `map[string]any` from
`yaml.Marshal` is a reproducibility hazard called out in CLAUDE.md.

## Operational Surfaces

**Graceful shutdown.** `Serve` installs a `signal.NotifyContext` for
`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` at the entry point so cancellation propagates through
both pre-`Run` setup and request handling. `Server.Shutdown` flips
`/ready` to 503 immediately, then calls `httpServer.Shutdown(ctx)` with
`defaults.ServerShutdownTimeout` (30s, overridable via
`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). A fresh `context.Background()` is used
intentionally — the parent is already canceled.

**Rate limiting.** Token bucket from `golang.org/x/time/rate`. Defaults
to 100 rps with burst 200. Limiter is re-created on every `New()` call.
Limiter headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `-Remaining`, `-Reset`) ship on
every response, not just 429s, so clients can back off proactively.

**Panic recovery.** Wraps `rateLimit` + `bodyLimit` + handler. A panic
becomes a 500 via `WriteError(..., ErrCodeInternal, ...)`, increments
the `aicr_server_panic_recoveries_total` counter, and logs the full
panic value at Error. The `loggingMiddleware` is outside this layer so
the completion log still fires.

**Version negotiation.** `versionMiddleware` parses `Accept` headers
of the form `application/vnd.nvidia.aicr.v<N>+json`, validates against
the allow-list in `isValidAPIVersion` (currently `v1` only), and sets
`X-API-Version` on the response. Unknown or absent version → `v1`.
Add `v2` by extending the map in `version.go`.

**Metrics.** Prometheus collectors registered via `promauto` in
`metrics.go`: `aicr_server_requests_total{method,path,status}`,
`aicr_server_request_duration_seconds`, `aicr_server_requests_in_flight`,
`aicr_server_rate_limit_rejects_total`,
`aicr_server_panic_recoveries_total`.

## Testing

Use `httptest.NewRecorder` with the handler directly. Inject a fake
or real `aicr.Client` constructed against an embedded data source.
Do **not** start a full `Server` — exercising the middleware chain
belongs in `middleware_test.go`.

```go
client, _ := aicr.NewClient(aicr.WithRecipeSource(aicr.EmbeddedSource()))
h := newRecipeHandler(client, nil)

req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/v1/recipe?service=eks&accelerator=h100", nil)
w := httptest.NewRecorder()
h.HandleRecipes(w, req)

if w.Code != http.StatusOK { t.Fatalf("status = %d", w.Code) }
```

Pattern reminders from CLAUDE.md:

- Table-driven test cases when there are multiple inputs.
- Always check `ctx.Done()` if the handler under test spawns goroutines.
- Never use a live cluster; the facade with `EmbeddedSource()` is fully in-process.

The handlers, middleware chain, and `Server.Run` lifecycle are covered
by in-process Go tests under
[`pkg/server`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/tree/main/pkg/server)
(`recipe_handler_test.go`, `middleware_test.go`, `serve_test.go`, and
peers), which drive the facade against the embedded data set without a
live cluster.
