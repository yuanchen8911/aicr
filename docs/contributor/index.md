# AICR Contributor Guide

You've landed in the contributor entry point. Its job is to give you,
in five minutes, a clear answer to four questions:

1. What is AICR, and what shape does it have?
2. Is the change I want to make in or out of scope?
3. Which file or package do I touch?
4. Where do I go next?

For dev-environment setup, run `make tools-setup` and read
[DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).
For contribution mechanics (DCO, CI, signing), see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
For the coding rules every PR is graded against, see
[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md).

## What AICR Is

AICR is a **design-time tool**. Given a description of a target
environment — cluster, accelerator, intent, OS, platform — it
generates validated GPU-cluster configuration artifacts that an
established deployment tool (Helm, Argo CD, Flux, Helmfile) consumes.

| Artifact | Role | Produced by |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Snapshot** | Normalized state of an existing cluster (input) | `aicr snapshot` or the in-cluster Job |
| **Recipe** | Declarative spec resolved from registry, criteria, overlays, and mixins | `aicr recipe` |
| **Validation report** | Recipe constraints evaluated against a snapshot or live cluster | `aicr validate` |
| **Bundle** | Per-component deployment artifact in a tool-specific format | `aicr bundle` |
| **Evidence** | Signed conformance attestation for a validated recipe | `aicr evidence` |

Each stage produces a serializable artifact (file, stdout, or
ConfigMap) and is independently invocable. Reproducibility — same
inputs, same outputs — is non-negotiable.

```text
┌──────────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌────────┐
│ Snapshot │───▶│ Recipe │───▶│ Validate │───▶│ Bundle │
└──────────┘    └────────┘    └──────────┘    └────────┘
   capture       generate       check          emit
   cluster       optimized      constraints    deployment
   state         config         vs. actual     artifacts
```

Stages can be invoked individually or chained. Inputs and outputs
flow through files, stdout, or Kubernetes ConfigMaps
(`cm://namespace/name`), which lets the snapshot agent hand off to a
CLI or API server running outside the cluster.

## What AICR Is Not

AICR is not a deployment engine. The boundary matters: half of all
"can AICR do X?" questions resolve against this list.

| AICR does | AICR does **not** |
|-----------|------------------|
| Generate `values.yaml`, `Application`, `HelmRelease`, etc. | Run `kubectl apply` or `helm install` |
| Validate constraints against a snapshot | Wait for resources to become ready |
| Sign and verify evidence bundles | Implement uninstall, rollback, or upgrade |
| Capture cluster state via a one-shot Job | Reconcile drift or run as a controller |
| Emit per-component artifacts in known formats | Orchestrate cross-component dependencies at runtime |

The deployment tool that consumes AICR's output (Helm, Argo CD, Flux,
Helmfile) owns release reconciliation and lifecycle.

**On terminology.** Code under `pkg/bundler/deployer` includes things
we call *deployers*. They are **output adapters** that serialize a
bundle in a tool-specific format. They do not perform deployment.

The only in-cluster component is the **snapshot agent** — a one-shot
Kubernetes Job that captures state into a ConfigMap and exits. It is
an input collector, not a runtime component, and is not part of the
deployed system.

## Is My Change In Scope?

The single most useful question to answer before writing code. If you
land in the right-hand column, file an issue or ADR first — the
review will not get past `make qualify` regardless of code quality.

| In scope (artifact generation) | Out of scope (deployment-time) |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| New recipe overlay or mixin | Apply / wait / uninstall logic embedded in AICR |
| New registry entry for an upstream chart | Drift detection or reconciliation loops |
| New snapshot collector dimension | In-cluster controllers or operators owned by AICR |
| New constraint operator | Custom deployment mechanisms (e.g., a "direct" deployer that calls `kubectl apply`) |
| New bundle output for a community-standard tool | Custom or proprietary delivery pipelines |
| Supply-chain provenance (SBOM, attestation, signing) | Anything that keeps AICR running past artifact generation |

A rule of thumb: if a feature requires AICR to keep running after
artifact generation, or to drive `kubectl` and direct API calls to
deploy what it produces, it belongs in a deployment tool — not AICR.

## Your First Contribution

A typical first PR path:

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   and [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md).
2. Run `make tools-setup` then `make qualify`. If qualify is green on
   `main`, your environment works.
3. Find your change in the [decision matrix](#where-does-my-change-go).
   Open the linked guide and follow its walkthrough.
4. Write the change. Run `make qualify` (or the package-scoped
   subset) until it passes. Lint and test failures must be fixed
   locally — do not rely on CI.
5. If you changed `registry.yaml`, a component values file, or a
   chart pin, run `make bom-docs` and commit the regenerated
   `docs/user/container-images.md`. CLAUDE.md treats this as a
   hard rule.
6. Sign the commit (`git commit -s -S` — DCO sign-off **and** cryptographic
   signature, both required), open a PR, and let CI run.

Use the PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` as-is — do
not inline a modified copy. Reviewers grade against
[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md);
familiarity with the anti-patterns table is the difference between
"shipped" and "round trip."

## Codebase Shape

Three layers. The separation is the single most enforced rule in
review.

```text
   ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
   │   pkg/cli           │     │   pkg/server        │   user interaction
   │   (CLI commands)    │     │   (HTTP handlers)   │   — no business logic
   └──────────┬──────────┘     └──────────┬──────────┘
              │                            │
              ▼                            ▼
              ┌──────────────────────────────┐
              │      pkg/client/v1           │           shared facade
              │      (aicr.Client)           │
              └────────────────┬─────────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  pkg/recipe   pkg/collector   pkg/validator       │   functional packages
   │  pkg/bundler  pkg/snapshotter pkg/evidence        │   — business logic lives here
   │  pkg/constraints  pkg/serializer  pkg/manifest    │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`pkg/cli` and `pkg/server` parse input, validate it, and format
output. **They contain no business logic.** All business logic lives
in functional packages, composed by the `pkg/client/v1` facade so
both entry points share it. Adding business logic to `pkg/cli` or
`pkg/server` handlers is a boundary violation and will be rejected.

## Community-Standard Deployment Targets

AICR emits artifacts in formats consumed by community-standard
deployment tools:

| Deployer | Output | Use case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `helm` | Per-component `values.yaml` + install script | Direct Helm install |
| `helmfile` | `helmfile.yaml` declarative release manifest | GitOps with Helmfile |
| `argocd` | Argo CD `Application` manifests with sync-waves | Argo CD GitOps |
| `argocd-helm` | Argo CD `Application` referencing per-component Helm charts | Argo CD + upstream Helm |
| `flux` | Flux `HelmRelease` + `Kustomization` manifests | Flux GitOps |

We are open to adding additional community-standard targets when
there is demonstrated demand. We do **not** add custom or
proprietary deployment mechanisms: they pull deployment-time
orchestration into AICR — the boundary we are explicitly maintaining.

## Deployment Topologies

AICR can be invoked in three shapes. None are runtime components in
the deployed cluster — all are design-time tooling.

- **CLI.** Single binary. Local development, CI pipelines,
  troubleshooting.
- **API server.** Stateless HTTP service for programmatic recipe and
  bundle generation. Scales horizontally behind a load balancer.
  Returns artifacts; does not deploy them. See
  [api-server.md](api-server.md).
- **Snapshot agent (one-shot Job).** A Kubernetes Job that runs
  once, captures state into a ConfigMap, and exits. The CLI or API
  server reads the ConfigMap as input. No reconcile loop, no
  controller.

## Architectural Principles

Coding rules and anti-patterns live in
[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.claude/CLAUDE.md).
The four principles that shape the architecture itself:

- **Metadata is separate from how it is consumed.** Validated
  configuration exists independent of how it is rendered, packaged,
  or deployed. A recipe is a value, not a procedure.
- **Correctness must be reproducible.** Same inputs → same outputs.
  This rules out hidden state, implicit defaults, and
  non-deterministic serialization. `serializer.MarshalYAMLDeterministic`
  is required wherever output feeds a digest, signature, or
  fingerprint.
- **Recipe specialization requires explicit intent.** Generic intent
  must never silently resolve to a specialized configuration. If two
  recipes both match, the user explicitly chooses; AICR does not
  guess.
- **Trust requires verifiable provenance.** Every released artifact
  carries verifiable, non-falsifiable proof of where it came from.
  See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Key Engineering Decisions

These five decisions shape how the codebase is laid out. Code that
fights them tends to read as a re-architecture.

- **Concurrent collection with `errgroup`.** Collectors run in
  parallel under an `errgroup`. Snapshot collection is best-effort:
  `collectSafe` logs an individual collector's failure and returns
  `nil`, so one collector erroring degrades the snapshot gracefully
  rather than aborting the whole capture.
- **Pluggable collectors via factory.** Collectors implement a
  common interface and are constructed by `pkg/collector.Factory`,
  then wired into the snapshot run by `pkg/snapshotter`. Adding a
  state source means a new `Factory` method and one `g.Go(...)`
  line in the snapshotter — no edits to existing collectors. See
  [collector.md](collector.md).
- **Immutable recipe store.** Read-only after init. Mutations on
  per-request clones. No locks; API server is safe for concurrent
  reads.
- **Singleton Kubernetes client.** `pkg/k8s/client` caches a single
  clientset to avoid connection exhaustion. Both in-cluster and
  out-of-cluster auth are supported transparently.
- **Watch over poll.** Long-running K8s operations use the watch API
  rather than polling loops. See `pkg/k8s/pod`.
