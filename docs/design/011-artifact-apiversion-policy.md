# ADR-011: Artifact apiVersion Policy and Compatibility Gate

> **Amended by [ADR-022](022-artifact-maturity-and-deprecation.md).** ADR-022
> introduces a per-kind maturity map for v1. It amends §1 so package-local
> constants select a kind-specific version defined by `pkg/header`, amends §3 so
> acceptance is scoped by wire kind and schema track and covers AICR catalog
> inputs, and replaces §4 with maturity-specific windows. The current
> empty-`apiVersion` tolerance remains in force until ADR-022's staged initial
> migration retires it. §2 stands unchanged.
>
> **Amended by [ADR-015](015-recipe-configuration-profiles.md).** ADR-015
> introduces kind-scoped version evolution: `RecipeMetadata` and
> `RecipeResult` accept `aicr.run/v1alpha3` for profile-bearing artifacts
> (dual-accepted alongside the legacy version), while snapshots, configs,
> and `RecipeCriteria` stay on `aicr.run/v1alpha2`. The single-version
> posture below is otherwise unchanged.

## Problem

`aicr validate` consumes three artifacts that may have been produced by
different `aicr` versions: the snapshot, the recipe, and the running binary.
Until now nothing enforced a compatibility contract between them. Two failure
modes followed:

- **Silent schema drift.** A recipe or snapshot produced by an incompatible
  `aicr` version could be loaded structurally with no signal, surfacing later
  as a confusing validation failure with no obvious cause.
- **No meaningful version contract.** Every artifact carries an `apiVersion`
  (then `aicr.nvidia.com/v1alpha1`), but the string was:
  - **frozen since repo init** — never bumped, with breaking schema changes
    shipped *within* `v1alpha1`;
  - **redefined as ~5 independent string literals** (`pkg/snapshotter`,
    `pkg/recipe` result + criteria, `pkg/config`) that agreed only by
    coincidence, with doc drift (`/v1` vs `/v1alpha1`) already present;
  - **unenforced on read** — snapshot loading ignored it entirely; recipe
    loading checked only `Kind`.

So an `apiVersion` match guaranteed nothing and a mismatch never occurred. This
ADR makes the `apiVersion` a real, single-sourced, enforced contract.

A predecessor change (#1386) added a *soft, advisory* warning comparing the
embedded **binary version** strings. That remains useful as a debugging
breadcrumb but is unsigned and noisy across dev builds; it is not a contract.
This ADR establishes the durable, schema-level gate.

## Non-Goals

- **Bumping the version segment now.** *(At the time of this ADR.)* No breaking
  schema change was being made, so the version stayed `v1alpha1`; bumping with
  no schema change would have orphaned every existing artifact for zero benefit.
  This non-goal was later overridden by [ADR-013](013-aicr-run-domain-migration.md):
  the `aicr.run` domain rename is itself a breaking change, so it carried a
  signal-only bump to `v1alpha2` to make the cut explicit.
- **Gating non-artifact `apiVersion`s.** The validator catalog
  (`validator.nvidia.com/...`), provenance predicate, and Zarf/Hauler mirror
  formats are separate schemas with their own domains/versions and are out of
  scope.
- **Signing or authenticating the artifact header.** The embedded `apiVersion`
  (like the snapshot fingerprint) is unsigned, advisory metadata. This gate
  catches accidental version skew, not a motivated attacker editing the file.
- **A `--skip-version-check` escape hatch.** The gate fails closed with no
  bypass; the well-formed path is to regenerate the artifact with a matching
  `aicr` version.

## Decision

### 1. Single source of truth

`pkg/header` is the canonical home for the artifact group/version:

- `header.Domain` = `aicr.run` (single source of truth; see ADR-013)
- `header.APIGroup` = `header.Domain` = `aicr.run`
- `header.APIVersionV1Alpha2` = `v1alpha2`
- `header.GroupVersion` = `aicr.run/v1alpha2`

All package-local constants alias a `pkg/header` constant rather than
redeclaring the literal: `snapshotter.FullAPIVersion`,
`recipe.RecipeResultAPIVersion`, `recipe.RecipeMetadataAPIVersion`,
`recipe.RecipeCriteriaAPIVersion`, `recipe.ComponentRegistryAPIVersion`,
`recipe.RecipeProfileAPIVersion`, `recipe.ConfiguredRecipeResultAPIVersion`,
`localformat.ProvenanceAPIVersion`, and `config.APIVersion`. Per the ADR-022 amendment below, each aliases the
constant for its wire kind's schema track (`header.StableGroupVersion`,
`header.AuthoringGroupVersion`, or `header.ProfileGroupVersion`) rather than
`header.GroupVersion` directly.

> **ADR-022 amendment.** `pkg/header` remains the canonical home for
> the API group, version segments, and complete group/version strings, but the
> single `header.GroupVersion` alias is no longer the universal policy. Each
> package-local emitter constant selects the header-defined version assigned to
> its wire kind and schema track. No package redeclares a version literal.
> During ADR-022 Release N, existing emitters intentionally remain on their
> alpha aliases while readers also accept the target constants.

### 2. Evolution rule

- Schema changes within a version MUST be **additive-only** (new optional
  fields). Existing artifacts must continue to deserialize. This matches the
  current backward-compat strategy already covered by
  `pkg/serializer/reader_recipe_compat_test.go`.
- A **breaking** change (removing/renaming a field, changing semantics, or a
  required-field addition) requires a **new version segment**
  (e.g. `v1alpha2`).

### 3. Compatibility gate (accept-known / reject-unknown)

The shared `pkg/header` gates report whether a non-empty `apiVersion` is one
this binary understands for the artifact's wire kind and schema track. The
snapshot and recipe loaders apply them:

- **Empty `apiVersion`** → accepted (older artifacts predate the field; matches
  the existing empty-`Kind` tolerance).
- **`apiVersion` supported for this wire kind and schema track** → accepted.
- **Non-empty unknown `apiVersion`** → rejected with
  `ErrCodeInvalidRequest` and a message naming the value, the expected value,
  and the remediation (regenerate/recapture with a matching `aicr` version).

> **ADR-022 amendment.** Every AICR artifact gate is kind/schema-scoped and the
> gate extends to AICR catalog inputs. Raw `RecipeMetadata`, `RecipeMixin`, and
> `ComponentRegistry` headers are validated before hydration or merge; empty or
> unknown catalog headers fail closed. The initial migration retains the
> existing empty-value exceptions in the snapshot, recipe, and criteria loaders
> until Release N+2. `AICRConfig` remains strict and has no exception to retire.

The gate lives in the shared loaders — `recipe.LoadFromFileWithProvider` (used
by both CLI and server via `pkg/client/v1`) and the new
`snapshotter.LoadFromFile` / `LoadFromFileWithKubeconfig`, which `validate`,
`query`, and `diff` route through — so enforcement is uniform across entry
points. (Those three now reach the snapshot loader via
`pkg/client/v1.Client.LoadSnapshot` rather than calling it directly, which
strengthens rather than changes this: SDK consumers hit the same gate.) This mirrors the strict reject already in `pkg/config` (`Validate`) and
`pkg/recipe` criteria parsing.

### 4. Transition window on a future bump

> **Replaced by ADR-022 §4 and §6.** The text below is retained as historical
> context and is no longer normative. ADR-022's maturity-specific obligations
> and rollout sequences govern future bumps.

When the schema is bumped (e.g. to `v1alpha2`), add the new value to
`header.IsSupportedAPIVersion` **while keeping the old one**, so a transition
window accepts both. Retire the old value only after the deprecation window
closes. Add a regression test asserting an out-of-window version is rejected.

**Exception — the `aicr.run` domain migration (ADR-013) was a hard break.**
Because it was a pre-v1, simultaneous domain-and-version change with all
fixtures regenerated in lockstep, the dual-accept window this policy normally
allows was intentionally *not* used: the legacy `aicr.nvidia.com/v1alpha1` value
is rejected outright rather than accepted alongside `aicr.run/v1alpha2`. See
ADR-013 for the rationale.

## Consequences

- An artifact stamped with an unsupported `apiVersion` now fails fast at load
  with a clear, actionable error instead of failing obscurely downstream.
- Version literals remain single-sourced in `pkg/header`; kind-specific emitter
  constants and read gates select among those header-defined values.
- During ADR-022 Release N, emitters still use `aicr.run/v1alpha2` for
  general/default artifacts and `aicr.run/v1alpha3` for profile-bearing
  `RecipeMetadata` and `RecipeResult`. Kind/schema-scoped readers additionally
  accept their `aicr.run/v1`, `aicr.run/v1beta1`, or `aicr.run/v1beta2` target.
  Older snapshots, recipes, and criteria may carry an empty `apiVersion` and
  remain tolerated; catalogs and `AICRConfig` do not. Per ADR-013's hard break, legacy
  `aicr.nvidia.com/v1alpha1` artifacts are rejected and must be regenerated.
- The gate is intentionally not a security control; the unsigned header can
  still be edited. Authenticated provenance remains the supply-chain workstream.
