#   ./validate-scheduling.sh h100-eks-ubuntu-training-kubeflow

#                       For argocd-* values the in-cluster registry + Argo CD

#                       `kwok/scripts/install-infra.sh` keyed on the DEPLOYER
#                       env var.
#
# Environment variables (GitOps deployers only):
#   KWOK_REGISTRY_HOST_PORT  Host port the in-cluster registry is reachable on
#                            from the runner. MUST match the value used when
#                            running install-infra.sh / kind-config.yaml.
#                            Default: 5500 (avoids the macOS ControlCenter
#                            port-5000 collision; Linux CI runners have 5500
#                            free as well).
#   KWOK_ARGOCD_SYNC_TIMEOUT Seconds to wait for all Argo CD Applications to
#                            reach Synced + Healthy (or Progressing) before
#                            failing. Default: 480 (matches the chainsaw test's
#                            spec.timeouts.assert: 8m).
#   KWOK_ARGOCD_ROOT_GRACE   Seconds to wait for the root Argo CD Application
#                            (nvidia-stack for argocd-oci, aicr-stack for
#                            argocd-helm-oci) to appear in the argocd
#                            namespace before failing. A missing root after
#                            this grace window indicates `kubectl apply` /
#                            `helm install` silently produced no Application
#                            resource. Default: 30.
#   KWOK_FLUX_SYNC_TIMEOUT   Seconds to wait for the outer Kustomization +
#                            all HelmReleases to reach a terminal state
#                            before failing. Default: 500.
#   KWOK_FLUX_ROOT_GRACE     Seconds to wait for the outer Kustomization to
#                            appear in the cluster before failing. A missing
#                            Kustomization after the grace window indicates
#                            kubectl apply silently produced no resource
#                            (RBAC denial, CRD missing). Default: 30.
#   KWOK_SYNC_DEADLINE_EPOCH Absolute unix-epoch deadline for sync-gate work.
#                            Set by CI (.github/actions/kwok-test) in the
#                            action's FIRST step — before toolchain setup
#                            and the aicr build — from the job's
#                            timeout-minutes minus a 240s diagnostics
#                            margin, so pre-action drift stays within the
#                            margin's 60s allowance. When set, each
#                            sync-gate budget becomes min(default, deadline
#                            − now); below a 120s floor the gate fails
#                            fast with exit 50 instead of letting the job
#                            timeout destroy chainsaw's catch-block
#                            diagnostics. Unset locally: fixed defaults
#                            apply.
#   KWOK_GITEA_HOST_PORT     (flux-git / argocd-git) Host port the in-cluster
#                            Gitea is reachable on from the runner for
#                            `git push`. MUST match install-infra.sh /
#                            kind-config.yaml. Default: 3300.
#   KWOK_GITEA_USER          (flux-git / argocd-git) Gitea user to push as.
#                            Must match the admin user bootstrapped by
#                            install-infra.sh. Default: aicr.
#   KWOK_GITEA_PASSWORD      (flux-git / argocd-git) Password for KWOK_GITEA_USER.
#                            CI-only credential for the ephemeral in-cluster
#                            Gitea — not a secret. Default: aicr-kwok-ci.

# This script:
# 1. Generates a recipe from the cluster config
# 2. Generates a bundle from the recipe
# 3. Deploys the bundle to the KWOK cluster (Helm, Argo CD, or Flux per --deployer)
# 4. Verifies all pods reach Running state (KWOK auto-transitions them)
# 5. Reports success/failure
#
# Exit codes:
#    0  success
#    1  generic failure (bundle gen, deploy, pod scheduling, RBAC, CRD missing,
#       apiserver unreachable, etc.)

# FLUX_GITREPOSITORY_NAME (flux-git) names the OUTER GitRepository this

# filesystem --output the bundler bakes its OWN GitRepository source CR
# into the bundle (sources/gitrepo-<sanitized-url>.yaml, derived from
# --repo) and local-chart HelmReleases reference THAT object, not this
# one. Two GitRepository objects pointing at the same repo is accepted
# duplication — reproducing the Go sanitizeSourceName() truncation logic

    # - PrometheusRules and AlertManager (slow to create)
    # - Nodewright customization (creates CRs that depend on operator CRDs)
    # - slinky-slurm-operator webhook + cert-manager wiring: the operator's
    #   webhook validates Slurm CRs through a Service whose pod runs on a
    #   KWOK fake (Ready without container). Both certManager.enabled and
    #   webhook.enabled gate the cert-manager.io/Certificate submission
    #   plus the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration. Disabling them skips
    #   admission entirely; harmless under KWOK since no real Slurm CRs
    #   are reconciled.
    # - slinky-slurm controller persistence: the chart provisions a PVC
    #   via the cluster's default StorageClass. Kind's local-path provisioner
    #   binds with WaitForFirstConsumer, so the PVC is pinned to whichever
    #   node the pod schedules on — and KWOK fakes can't actually back a
    #   local-path volume, leaving the pod stuck Pending with NominatedNodeName
    #   set. Disabling persistence lets the controller pod bind.

# Chainsaw-based sync gate for the argocd-* and flux-oci deployer lanes.
# Replaces the ~500-line bash + jq machinery (wait_for_argocd_root_app,
# wait_for_argocd_sync, dump_argocd_failures, and their flux-* peers) with
# thin shims that invoke the canonical chainsaw scenarios under
# tests/chainsaw/kwok/{argocd,flux}-sync/. See issue #962.
#
# The bash side still owns:
#
#   1. Per-deployer binding selection (ARGOCD_ROOT_APP shape, Flux CR
#      names) — set in the matrix-shape preamble at the top of this file.
#   2. Exit-code translation. Chainsaw collapses pass / fail to 0 / 1;
#      run-all-recipes.sh's 3-strike rule needs EXIT_ARGOCD_SYNC_TIMEOUT
#      (50) on the retryable path. The shim maps chainsaw exit 1 to 50
#      unconditionally — hard errors (CRD missing, RBAC denial) thus
#      consume strike budget instead of failing fast. Three consecutive
#      hard errors still bail the matrix job; the behavior difference
#      vs. the old bash gate is that they take three attempts instead
#      of one. Accept the tradeoff for the ~500 LOC reduction.
#   3. Failure-class logging. Chainsaw emits its own assertion report;
#      the shim adds a one-line log_info on PASS and log_error on FAIL
#      so the run-all-recipes.sh transcript still has a single grep-able
#      summary line per recipe.
#
# Chainsaw provides:
#
#   - Polling loop with deadline (spec.timeouts.assert overridden via
#     --assert-timeout from KWOK_*_SYNC_TIMEOUT).
#   - Per-resource assertion that ALL Applications / HelmReleases / etc.
#     match the terminal-pass predicate.
#   - catch: blocks that dump per-resource status + controller log tails
#     on assertion failure (parity with the prior dump_*_failures bash).
#
# Diagnostic-parity audit:
#
#   - dump_argocd_failures bash               → argocd-sync test's catch block
#   - dump_flux_failures bash                 → flux-sync test's per-step catch blocks
#   - StatefulSet/Deployment fallback for     → preserved verbatim in the
#     argocd-application-controller logs       argocd-sync catch script
#   - Flux source-watcher Deployment/         → preserved verbatim in the
#     StatefulSet fallback                     flux-sync ArtifactGenerator catch
