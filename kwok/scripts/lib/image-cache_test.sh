# Unit harness for lib/image-cache.sh (pull-once / load-many image cache).
#
# The property under test is the mirror image of preload-image_test.sh. There,
# every case asserts rc=0 because preload_image must never fail the lane. Here,
# image_cache_save is a GATE: the CI prime job runs it once so 127 matrix jobs
# never touch the upstream registry, and a save that reports success without
# producing a usable tarball would send all 127 back to the pull it exists to
# remove -- with the gate lit green. So the interesting assertions are that
# failures are LOUD, and that a partial tarball is never published.
#
# image_cache_load keeps the best-effort contract: a miss returns non-zero for
# the caller to shrug at, because the kubelet pull is still behind it.
#
# Run directly: bash kwok/scripts/lib/image-cache_test.sh
# Wired into CI by the kwok-recipes discover job.
