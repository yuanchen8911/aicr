# image-cache.sh - pull once, load many: a tarball cache for the public images
# the KWOK lanes need, so a run does not depend on an unauthenticated
# third-party registry pull at job time (#2483).
#
# The problem this solves is a per-IP registry throttle, not an outage. In the
# run that motivated it, 127 concurrent matrix jobs each pulled
# public.ecr.aws/docker/library/registry:3.1.1 at the same moment from the same
# runner egress IPs; 125 succeeded and 1 was shed, reddening main. Retrying
# harder cannot fix a quota shared across the matrix -- the fix is to stop
# making 127 requests. One job pulls and saves a tarball, actions/cache carries
# it, and every matrix job loads from disk.
#
# Used by:
#   .github/workflows/kwok-recipes.yaml  (prime-images job -> `save`)
#   .github/actions/kwok-test/action.yml (matrix jobs      -> `key` and `load`)
#
# Both sides derive the cache key from the same function here rather than from
# a value threaded through the reusable workflow: if the two could disagree,
# every restore would miss and the cache would silently do nothing while
# reporting success.
#
# Sourced by image-cache_test.sh (with stubbed docker); executed directly by
# the workflow. `save` and `load` differ deliberately in how loud they are:
#
#   save  is a GATE. The prime job runs it once so the matrix never touches the
#         registry, so a save that reports success without producing a usable
#         tarball is worse than no cache at all -- it sends all 127 jobs back to
#         the pull with the gate lit green. Every failure path returns non-zero.
#
#   load  is BEST EFFORT, like preload_image. A miss returns non-zero for the
#         caller to shrug at: preload_image still pulls, and the kubelet still
#         pulls behind that. A cache miss must never fail a lane.
