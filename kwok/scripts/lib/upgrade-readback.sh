# Comparison half of the inventory read-back (ADR-021 acceptance criterion
# 4, issue #2531). validate-scheduling.sh runs `aicr upgrade-check` twice
# against the same target, once with `--from cluster` and once with
# `--from <bundle>`, and hands both reports here.
#
# The bundle is the oracle. The recipe.yaml at its root lists exactly the
# releases the bundler emitted, at exactly the versions it pinned, so there
# is no golden to maintain and nothing to drift against: a per-component
# divergence is by construction a defect in the cluster read rather than in
# this comparison.
#
# It lives in its own file so the comparison is unit-testable against
# fixture reports, the negative cases especially, since the dangerous
# failure here is a check that passes on an ambiguous condition rather than
# one that is merely wrong.
#
# Source guard: constants and functions only, no side effects at source
# time (same contract as lib/cleanup.sh).

# What is compared: the per-component rows (which component, what kind of
# change, the `from` and `to` versions, and the verdict with the reason that
# produced it), plus the summary counts.
#
# What is deliberately not, because it differs by construction rather than
# by defect:
#   - the top-level `from`, the literal "cluster" on one side and a bundle
#     path on the other;
#   - `source`, which accounts for a cluster read and is absent from an
#     artifact comparison that contacted no cluster (compare_upgrade_readback
#     asserts on it separately, where its absence means something);
#   - `atRisk`, which a cluster read implies and an artifact comparison does
#     not perform, and whose counts are advisory and depend on whatever else
#     is on the cluster at the moment of the scan.
#
# `jq -S` plus the sort_by makes the rendering canonical, so a diff of two
# projections shows semantic differences only.
