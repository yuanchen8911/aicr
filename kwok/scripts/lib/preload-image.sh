# preload-image.sh - side-load a public image into the Kind node so the
# kubelet never has to pull it mid-rollout.
#
# Sourced by install-infra.sh. Kept as its own lib (like sync-budget.sh and
# profile-select.sh) so the retry and cluster-resolution logic can be unit
# tested with stubbed docker/kind instead of only in a live CI lane.
#
# Callers must provide log_info / log_warn / log_debug; install-infra.sh
# defines them before sourcing this file.

# Total wall-clock budget for preloading ONE image, across every retry and the
# side-load. Overridable for tests.
#
# A per-operation timeout would not be enough: three stalled pulls plus a stalled
# load still multiply out. The budget is checked before each operation and passed
# to `timeout`, and the retry backoff is clamped to it as well, so no number of
# retries can make the function outlive it.
#
# The one deliberate exception is the final "is it cached" probe, which is given
# at least PRELOAD_PROBE_TIMEOUT even once the deadline is spent (see
# preload_image_cached). The real ceiling is therefore the budget plus at most
# one probe floor. That is one probe per call, not per retry, so it does not
# scale with the retry count.
# 180s is generous for two small images and leaves the 20-minute KWOK job budget
# essentially intact even if both preloads time out completely.
#
# Read at CALL time, not source time, so a caller (or a test) can change it
# between invocations.
KWOK_PRELOAD_BUDGET_DEFAULT=180

# Retry backoff schedule, in seconds: doubles from START, capped at MAX. The cap
# keeps a long budget from spending itself on one enormous sleep, which would
# leave no attempt near the end of the window.
PRELOAD_BACKOFF_START=5
PRELOAD_BACKOFF_MAX=30

# FLOOR for a single "is this image cached" probe (see preload_image_cached).
# A probe gets at least this long even when the run budget is spent, and more
# when the budget still has more to give. It is a floor and not a cap precisely
# so it cannot narrow the allowance a busy daemon would otherwise have had.
#
# It therefore bounds a wedged Docker Engine only on the budget-spent path;
# while budget remains the probe may wait for most of it, exactly as the
# deadline-bound check it replaced always did. The ceiling that matters to a
# lane is the run budget, and this constant is what keeps a spent one from
# collapsing the probe to zero.
PRELOAD_PROBE_TIMEOUT=5

# Side-load an image into the Kind node so the kubelet never pulls it.
#
# The registry and Gitea Deployments were the first workloads in the KWOK lanes
# whose images come from a public registry, and both used to be pulled by the
# kubelet inside a 120s rollout budget with no retry. That made every lane
# depend on a single upstream reach at exactly the wrong moment: an ECR blip
# surfaced as "Registry Deployment did not become Ready within 120s", exit 20,
# and a red matrix cell with nothing wrong in the repo. It was the single
# largest source of KWOK-lane failures.
#
# Argo CD's Redis joined them later (#2501). It differs in that its Deployment
# comes from the chart rather than this repo, so it is preloaded before
# `helm install` rather than before an applied manifest.
#
# Pulling on the host instead has three advantages: `docker pull` can be
# retried without holding a rollout budget open, the runner's Docker cache
# survives across lanes in a job, and every one of these Deployments sets
# imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent, so a preloaded image is used as-is.
#
# BEST EFFORT BY DESIGN. Every failure path here logs and returns 0, leaving
# the kubelet pull as the fallback exactly as before. This function must not
# become a new way for the lane to fail: it removes a failure mode or it does
# nothing. That is why it never propagates an error, even when docker or kind
# is missing entirely (a non-Kind cluster, or a dev box driving a remote one).
# preload_remaining prints the seconds left before the deadline, and returns 1
# when the budget is spent so callers can bail instead of starting an operation
# they cannot finish.

    left=$(( deadline - $(date +%s) ))

# preload_have_image reports whether the image is already in the host's Docker
# cache, bounded by the remaining budget.
#
# Bounded because `docker image inspect` is a request to the Docker Engine, not
# a local file read: a wedged daemon stalls it like any other call. Inside the
# retry loop it would stall once per attempt before the kubelet fallback could
# run — the same unbounded-wait failure this function exists to remove.
#
# A spent budget reports "not cached", which is the right reading INSIDE the
# loop: there is no time left to pull, so the loop must stop. It is the wrong
# reading for a final verdict — see preload_image_cached.

# preload_image_cached answers "is the image on this host", and unlike
# preload_have_image a spent DEADLINE does not make it answer no.
#
# The budget governs how long we spend TRYING to get the image, not how long we
# may take to OBSERVE the result. Gating a verdict on it conflates the two: a
# pull that succeeds with the last of the budget leaves the image cached and the
# deadline passed, and a budget-bounded check then reports the image as missing,
# so the log blames a pull that actually worked.
#
# Bounded by the LARGER of the remaining budget and PRELOAD_PROBE_TIMEOUT. The
# constant is a floor, not a cap: it guarantees a fair chance to answer once the
# deadline is spent, without narrowing the allowance a busy daemon would
# otherwise have had. Capping at the constant would trade the budget-spent false
# miss for a slow-daemon one. So this still reads the budget -- it just cannot
# be silenced by an exhausted one.
#
# Callers that need to know whether there is time left to do more WORK ask
# preload_remaining instead.

# preload_pull_retry gets IMAGE into the host's Docker cache before DEADLINE,
# retrying a failed pull until the budget is spent. Returns 0 when the image is
# cached on return, 1 when it is not — and logs the reason in that case.
#
# Split out from preload_image so the CI image-cache priming step
# (kwok/scripts/lib/image-cache.sh) reuses this exact retry schedule instead of
# growing a second one. The two callers differ only in what a failure means:
# preload_image degrades to the kubelet pull, priming fails its job.
#
# Retry until the BUDGET is spent, not for a fixed number of attempts.
#
# The fixed three-attempt schedule this replaces gave up in ~17s while holding a
# 180s budget (#2483): each pull failed in about a second, the backoff was 5s
# then 10s, and ~163s went unused. Against a per-IP registry throttle that is
# close to the worst possible schedule — it retries fast enough to stay inside
# the same throttle window, then stops long before the window would reset.
#
# Evidence it is a throttle and not an outage: in the run that motivated this,
# 125 of 127 concurrent matrix jobs pulled the same image successfully at the
# same moment. The pull is not broken; a few callers are being shed.
#
# Backoff doubles from PRELOAD_BACKOFF_START and is capped, so a long budget
# spends most of its time waiting rather than hammering.
