# Unit harness for the footprint GATE in .github/scripts/record-footprint.sh.
# Run directly: bash tools/record-footprint_test.sh
# Wired into CI via `make test` (test-shell target, runs tools/*_test.sh).
#
# WHY A GATE NEEDS A HARNESS. The script's first job is to record numbers, and
# a recorder cannot be wrong in a way anyone notices. Its second job is to fail
# the step when the runner is about to run out of room, and that job is only
# real if it can go RED. The assertions below drive each arm over its floor by
# injecting figures through a PATH stub, so the disk arm is exercised without
# ever filling a disk and the memory arm without a Linux host.
#
# Every expectation names the EXACT documented exit code, never merely
# non-zero: 0 within floors, 1 usage or bad configuration, 2 disk below floor,
# 3 memory below floor, 4 memory arm required but unmeasurable, 5 df figures
# unparseable. "Non-zero" would let a syntax error masquerade as a caught
# over-budget run.
#
# Hermetic with one deliberate exception, the "real machine" case below, which
# is the only proof that the host's own df and uname work at all; it asserts
# what holds on any host rather than that the host has headroom. No cluster, no
# network, no real disk pressure anywhere. The subject is
# resolved relative to THIS file so the harness exercises this worktree rather
# than whatever copy happens to be on PATH.

# --- The recording and the verdict must agree ---------------------------------
# `n/a` in the recording line is the ONLY evidence a reader has that the memory
# arm was skipped rather than judged, and the two lines carrying that claim come
# from two separate conditions in the subject. When those drifted apart the
# script printed real memory figures one line above a verdict announcing that
# the memory arm did not apply on this host, and the contradiction was invisible
# to every assertion that read one line at a time.
#
# Which direction of the invariant is live depends on the host. A skipped arm
# recording real figures needs a host whose default meminfo is readable while
# `uname` says otherwise, so it is live on Linux with UNAME_STUB and vacuous on
# macOS; a judged arm recording n/a is live everywhere, through an explicit
# source. The third run below leaves `uname` real, so it asserts whichever of
# the two THIS host can reach. Its df is stubbed: the invariant is about the
# memory arm, and an exit 2 from the host's own disk would only stop the
# comparison from being made at all.
#
# Only ever applied to a run that passed: the "does not apply" clause is printed
# by the pass path alone, so on a failing run its absence would say nothing and
# the comparison below would fire for the wrong reason. The rc is asserted here
# rather than assumed.
