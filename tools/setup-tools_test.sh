# This guard used to assert that every `go install` cleared GOFLAGS. #2667
# removed the last one, so the contract is now stricter and the guard asserts
# the stricter thing: no `go install pkg@version` at all.
#
# `go install pkg@version` resolves outside the main module. Nothing it builds
# is covered by this repo's go.sum, so every transitive dependency is
# authenticated against sum.golang.org on each run, and an outage there fails
# the install -- which is what took down tests / E2E on the v0.21.1 release
# (#2664) and still reached the qualification gate afterwards (#2667). Building
# from the main module verifies against the committed go.sum instead and never
# consults the checksum database.
#
# Anchor on start-of-line or whitespace before `go`, not on "some character then
# whitespace": the latter cannot see an unindented `go install` at column 1,
# which is exactly the shape this guard exists to catch. Requiring whitespace
# (rather than any non-`#` character) also keeps `cargo install` from matching.
#
# Comment lines are excluded so prose mentioning `go install` does not trip it.
