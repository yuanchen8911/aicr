# Unit harness for .github/scripts/uat-janitor.sh decision logic.
# Run directly: bash tools/uat-janitor_test.sh
# Wired into CI via `make test` (test-shell target).
#
# Hermetic: sources the janitor (its `main` guard means sourcing provisions
# nothing) and stubs `gh` on PATH, so no cloud CLI, credential, or network call
# is involved and no resource is ever touched. The assertions guard the
# safety-critical logic that decides whether a cloud deployment gets DESTROYED:
# the allowlist, the run-id requirement, the not-active liveness gate, the
# fail-closed handling of ambiguous GitHub API answers, and the age floors.
# Every ambiguous input must produce SKIP, never REAP.
