# Tests for the snapshot CTRF record in tests/uat/lib/phases.sh (#1806).
# phase_prep is driven with a stub aicr on PATH: pass, fail, interruption by
# TERM while the agent runs, and an unwritable report path. Each case pins the
# phase's exit status and the record on disk, because a wrapper that changed
# the phase's verdict, or lost the record on interruption, would defeat the
# point of adding it.
#
# Also covers the readiness phase split out of install (#2630): phase dispatch,
# install no longer running the gate, extraction of failing validators' output
# from each gate attempt's CTRF report, and the fallback when that report is
# missing or malformed -- which must never turn a failed gate into a pass.
