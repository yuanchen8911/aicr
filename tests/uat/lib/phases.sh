# Shared UAT phase library. Holds the cloud-agnostic phase implementations
# (prep, install, conformance, train, serve, verify, debug) and the phase
# dispatcher, sourced by the thin per-cloud runners tests/uat/{aws,gcp,azure}/run.
# The runners were ~identical (aws/gcp differed only in comment wording; azure
# added a federated-session refresh); this consolidates the shared body here and
# leaves each runner as a shim that sources this file and calls uat_main "$@".
#
# Cloud-specific behavior is injected through the cloud_refresh_credentials hook
# (default no-op; Azure overrides it to redeem a fresh federated OIDC assertion)
# and CLOUD_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS. Everything else is identical across clouds.
#
# Usage (from a per-cloud runner):
#   AICR_BIN=./aicr RUN_ID=12345 ./run <phase> <test-config.yaml>
#
# Phases:
#   prep         snapshot + recipe + dry-run validate + bundle
#   install      helmfile apply (deploys gpu-operator, kubeflow/dynamo, ...)
#   conformance  validate ALL phases (deployment + conformance + performance)
#                + emit signed evidence bundle
#   train        submit TrainJob, wait for completion, capture logs
#                (intent=training CUJ)
#   serve        deploy a DynamoGraphDeployment, wait for readiness, hit the
#                OpenAI-compatible endpoint, assert a completion, capture logs
#                (intent=inference CUJ — the DC3 counterpart of `train`)
#   verify       aicr evidence verify against the signed bundle
#   debug        snapshot live cluster state into cluster-debug/ (nodes, taints,
#                events, operator CRs incl. Skyhook status, operator/check-Job
#                logs) — best-effort, run on failure BEFORE teardown
#   all          run every phase in order (for local reproduction); the CUJ
#                phase is chosen by the config's recipe intent — `train` for
#                training, `serve` for inference
#
# Required env:
#   AICR_BIN    Path to the aicr binary
#   RUN_ID      Per-run correlation tag (`run-<id>`) applied to the evidence
#               push target (e.g. ${{ github.run_id }} in CI, or `local-$(date +%s)`)
#

# must span nodewright (skyhook) node tuning -- which REBOOTS the GPU node and
# re-inits the gpu-operator operands after the operator first reports ready (each
# validate run now polls internally, up to GPUReadinessTimeout, to ride through a
# reboot) -- plus cold-boot GPU-operator convergence
# (driver/toolkit/device-plugin/DCGM) and prometheus-adapter APIService
# aggregation, across the required consecutive passes. Sized at 60m because
# nodewright (skyhook) tuning plus its reboot cycles alone can run past 30m on a
# cold GPU node (the earlier 30m budget timed out purely waiting on tuning), and
# the gate must still have room to observe the required consecutive passes after
# tuning settles. Fails closed if exceeded.
READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS="${READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-3600}" # 60 min
# The gate requires the deployment phase to pass this many times CONSECUTIVELY
# before declaring readiness. A single pass proves "converged at instant T", not
# "will stay converged". TWO DIFFERENT threats motivate the streak:
#
# Reason 1 -- TEMPORAL FLAPPING of nodes that ALREADY EXIST: nodewright (skyhook)
# tuning reboots the GPU node more than once (the tuning packages carry
# interrupt: reboot) and re-opens status=in_progress after each reboot, so a pass
# can land in a lull between reboot cycles. Requiring N consecutive passes, spaced
# by the retry sleep, ensures the reboots have settled before the conformance
# phase (`--phase all`) runs -- any validate regression resets the counter.
#
# Reason 2 -- CENSUS GROWTH (issue #2096): the consecutive-pass streak defends
# ONLY against nodes that already exist. A not-yet-joined GPU node cannot fail a
# gate attempt, so the streak is structurally blind to it. When a late GPU node
# joins (observed 84s after a gate pass), Skyhook cordons+tunes it (taint
# skyhook.nvidia.com=runtime-required:NoSchedule + spec.unschedulable), re-opening
# convergence WHILE the later `--phase all` validate runs. So each streak-
# advancing attempt ALSO folds in a GPU-node census verdict (gpu_census_verdict):
# an attempt counts toward the streak only if validate passes AND the census is
# settled at that instant; a grown/cordoned census is treated as a regression and
# resets the streak, riding census growth out on the SAME READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
# budget as a reboot flap. (phase_conformance adds a second, adjacency-close census
# gate right before validate; see CENSUS_STABILITY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS below.)

    #   2. The .prov clearsign carries VALIDSIG for the pinned maintainer
    #      fingerprint                            — proves upstream authorship.
    #   3. The SHA256 recorded inside that signed .prov equals the pin
    #                                             — binds (2) to (1), so the
    #      signature covers our bytes, not some other signed release.
    #   4. The version inside that signed .prov equals the requested version
    #                                             — the only gate that survives
    #      a poisoned pin; see its comment below.
    #
    # Gate 1 is the load-bearing control against a *replayed older release*: a
    # stale tarball carries a genuine upstream signature but the wrong hash, so
    # it is rejected before any signature is examined. That is what helm's own
    # --verify cannot do — it establishes only (2) and would accept any validly
    # signed release — and it is why passing --verify=false here is strictly
    # stronger rather than weaker. Gates 3 and 4 cover what Gate 1 cannot: a pin
    # that was poisoned at refresh time, when the hash alone proves nothing.
    # The cost is a cosmetic `PROVENANCE: unsigned` in `helm plugin list`.
    #
    # The tarball is staged as diff.tgz because helm's local-tarball installer
    # derives both the expected archive root and the install directory from the
    # file's basename, and helm-diff's tarball is rooted at diff/.

    # this block without disturbing the parent shell's traps. Its `|| exit 1`

  # Deploy the served inference graph (Dynamo) — the intent=inference CUJ, the
  # DC3 counterpart of phase_train. Graph topology mirrors the
  # DynamoGraphDeployment in demos/cuj2-inference.md
  # (demos/workloads/inference/vllm-agg.yaml): the KAI queue and a
  # two-component (Frontend + decode Worker) graph serving an OpenAI-compatible
  # endpoint. Two intentional divergences from the demo: Frontend placement
  # (the demo pins nodeGroup=cpu-worker; this graph selects the GPU pool for
  # both components — pool-selection note below, #1644), and the worker
  # command (the demo uses python3 -m dynamo.vllm; this graph wraps it with
  # the GKE driver-lib append used by inference-perf, or vLLM cannot see
  # libcuda.so.1 on gke-default). The worker requests its GPU as a scalar
  # nvidia.com/gpu limit — the device-plugin production default (#1327).
  #
  # Tolerations are a portable SUPERSET of the taints across all UAT clusters
  # (AWS and GKE GPU pools use different `dedicated` values, the AKS pool carries
  # only nvidia.com/gpu; the DRA/gpu-operator adds nvidia.com/gpu). Tolerating a
  # taint a node does not carry is a no-op, so one list schedules correctly on
  # any of the clouds.
  #
  # Both components select the GPU pool (#1644). Left unselected, the Frontend
  # landed on a CPU-pool node (e2-standard-4 / n2-standard-8) and wedged in
  # ContainerCreating on the ~12GB vllm-runtime image, exceeding
  # SERVE_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: on 4-8 vCPUs with modest egress, both the
  # download and the CPU-bound layer decompression are slow. The GPU pool's
  # a3-megagpu-8g class pulls the same image in a fraction of the budget, which
  # is what this selector buys. It therefore also needs the nvidia.com/gpu
  # toleration (the AKS pool carries only that taint). Sharing the pool consumes
  # no device: the Frontend declares no nvidia.com/gpu limit, so the device
  # plugin never allocates one to it. This matches how the inference-perf
  # validator places every component on the GPU cohort
  # (validators/performance/inference_perf_constraint.go). The worker command
  # is the same GKE driver-lib append as that validator's Dynamo templates;
  # without it, vLLM crash-loops on gke-default (run 32732018329).
  #
  # This selects the POOL, not a node: the pool holds two GPU nodes and nothing
  # constrains the two components to the same one, so they may be split. That is
  # deliberate rather than an oversight — a split yields two pulls running in
  # PARALLEL on two high-bandwidth nodes, so readiness waits out roughly one
  # pull either way. Do not read the co-location as load-bearing; it is not, and
  # there is no shared cache to inherit (the operator creates both components at
  # once, so kubelet merely dedupes co-located pulls into one).
