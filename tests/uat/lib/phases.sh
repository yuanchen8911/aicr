# Shared UAT phase library. Holds the cloud-agnostic phase implementations
# (prep, install, conformance, train, serve, verify, debug) and the phase
# dispatcher, sourced by the thin per-cloud runners tests/uat/{aws,gcp,azure}/run.
# The runners were ~identical (aws/gcp differed only in comment wording; azure
# added a federated-session refresh); this consolidates the shared body here and
# leaves each runner as a shim that sources this file and calls uat_main "$@".
#
# Cloud-specific behavior is injected through the cloud_refresh_credentials hook
# (default no-op; Azure overrides it to redeem a fresh federated OIDC assertion)
# and CLOUD_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS. Everything else is identical across clouds.
#
# Usage (from a per-cloud runner):
#   AICR_BIN=./aicr RUN_ID=12345 ./run <phase> <test-config.yaml>
#
# Phases:
#   prep         snapshot + recipe + dry-run validate + bundle
#   install      helmfile apply (deploys gpu-operator, kubeflow/dynamo, ...)
#   conformance  validate ALL phases (deployment + conformance + performance)
#                + emit signed evidence bundle
#   train        submit TrainJob, wait for completion, capture logs
#                (intent=training CUJ)
#   serve        deploy a DynamoGraphDeployment, wait for readiness, hit the
#                OpenAI-compatible endpoint, assert a completion, capture logs
#                (intent=inference CUJ — the DC3 counterpart of `train`)
#   verify       aicr evidence verify against the signed bundle
#   debug        snapshot live cluster state into cluster-debug/ (nodes, taints,
#                events, operator CRs incl. Skyhook status, operator/check-Job
#                logs) — best-effort, run on failure BEFORE teardown
#   all          run every phase in order (for local reproduction); the CUJ
#                phase is chosen by the config's recipe intent — `train` for
#                training, `serve` for inference
#
# Required env:
#   AICR_BIN    Path to the aicr binary
#   RUN_ID      Per-run correlation tag (`run-<id>`) applied to the evidence
#               push target (e.g. ${{ github.run_id }} in CI, or `local-$(date +%s)`)
