# Guards both gates on the `platform` dispatch axis:
#
#   A. .github/workflows/uat-run.yaml, `resolve` job, "Resolve reservation row".
#      Answers "can this LANE serve a platform at all". Only run-kind forwards
#      the input; uat-aws/gcp/azure.yaml declare no platform input and build
#      TEST_CONFIG from intent alone, so a platform dispatched at a cloud
#      reservation used to be dropped at the job boundary and that cell ran its
#      default per-intent config to completion and reported SUCCESS for a recipe
#      nobody asked for. Nothing on that path failed, because the default config
#      exists, so the pipelines' own "test config not found" check never fired.
#
#   B. .github/workflows/uat-kind.yaml, `uat-kind` job, "Validate inputs".
#      Answers "is this a value the kind lane admits", which today is the empty
#      one and nothing else: that lane's cluster is single-node nvkind and the
#      only platform in the tree, slurm, needs four schedulable nodes. Admitting
#      it would spend a slot on a leased GPU runner before failing on three
#      Pending slurmd pods. The cell runs on uat-kind-sim.yaml instead.
#
# The two are deliberately separate: A is per-lane, B is per-value. Asserting
# both here keeps them from being merged into one duplicated list that drifts.
#
# Why it reads the workflows instead of holding a copy: each subject is
# EXTRACTED with yq at run time and executed verbatim, so this file cannot drift
# from the steps it protects. A transcribed copy would keep passing after
# someone edited the real one.
#
# Hermetic: `tools/uat-broker` is a local Go program that the resolve job's
# "Build uat-broker" step (also extracted and run here) builds from source, and `infra/uat/reservations.yaml` and the test configs are
# in-repo. No network, no cluster, no prebuilt binary.
#
# It never skips. A missing yq, a missing go, or a step that cannot be extracted
# is a FAILURE, not a skip: a suite that switches itself off when a dependency
# is absent reports green while checking nothing.
