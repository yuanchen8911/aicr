# Cloud-agnostic cluster debug-bundle collector, sourced by the per-cloud UAT
# `run` scripts (tests/uat/{aws,gcp}/run) and invoked as the `debug` phase from
# the workflows on failure — AFTER the failing phase, BEFORE teardown, while the
# cluster is still alive.
#
# The pre-existing `Upload failure debug` artifact only captured files already on
# the runner's disk (report.json, recipe, snapshot); it carried ZERO live cluster
# state, so a deployment-phase failure (e.g. a skyhook/nodewright tuning reboot
# re-opening status=in_progress, or a check Job's pod evicted by that reboot) had
# to be reconstructed from raw CI step logs. This collector snapshots the cluster
# state that actually explains those failures: node conditions + taints, the
# operator CRs (Skyhook status history the readiness gate keys off of), cluster
# events (reboots, evictions), and operator/check-Job pod logs (incl. --previous
# to survive a restart across a reboot).
#
# Everything here is BEST-EFFORT: every kubectl call is guarded with `|| true`,
# bounded by a per-command timeout (CLUSTER_DEBUG_CMD_TIMEOUT) so one hung call
# cannot starve later sections, and the whole collector is wrapped so it never
# fails the run or delays teardown (the caller also bounds it with a workflow
# `timeout-minutes`).
#
# Privacy: no Kubernetes Secret objects are fetched, and `kubectl describe pods`
# (which renders literal, non-Secret env values) is limited to the operator/check
# namespaces in CLUSTER_DEBUG_LOG_NAMESPACES — every other namespace gets only
# get/events. This is NOT a guarantee the bundle is credential-free: describe on
# the allowlisted namespaces and pod logs (incl. --previous) can still contain
# app-emitted credentials or PII. The bundle uploads as an Actions artifact on a
# PUBLIC repo (downloadable per the repo's artifact access) — treat it as
# sensitive. Redaction is deliberately not attempted (fragile); the namespace
# allowlist is the primary mitigation.
#
# On a GPU-count shortfall the bundle also carries driver-level state obtained by
# `kubectl exec` (read-only) into the on-node nvidia-dcgm pod: GPU UUIDs, PCI bus
# IDs, board serial numbers, and NVIDIA-driver `dmesg` (NVRM/Xid) lines. These
# are hardware identifiers / driver diagnostics — no Secrets, and intentionally
# captured for RMA (issue #1860) — but treated as sensitive like the rest.

# Platform-to-workload-CRD map (platform_workload_crd,
# platform_workload_platforms), shared with phase_conformance's coordinate
# cross-check so the CRs captured here cannot drift from the platforms the gate
# knows. Sourced explicitly rather than relying on the caller's source order;
# the map file has no side effects at source time, so sourcing it twice in one
# shell (phases.sh sources it too) is harmless.

# the actual status.status progression across the tuning-settling window — the
# complete→in_progress flips AS THEY HAPPEN — rather than only a single snapshot
# taken minutes later at teardown. This is the highest-value signal for the
