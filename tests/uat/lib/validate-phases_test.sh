# Guards VALIDATE_PHASES, the knob that decides which `aicr validate` phases a
# lane runs and, with them, whether the post-install readiness gate runs.
#
# TWO FAILURES ARE WORTH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS HERE, and the cases below are sized
# accordingly.
#
#   Dropping the gate on a lane that needs it is the expensive one: the cloud
#   lanes' readiness gate is what makes them wait out nodewright reboots and
#   gpu-operator convergence, and without it they validate a half-converged
#   cluster. So the DEFAULT is asserted first, and asserted to be "all".
#
#   Restoring it on the simulated lane is the cheap-but-wasteful one: that lane
#   cannot pass the deployment phase (it deploys a subset of its recipe), so the
#   gate would poll for a DRA kubelet plugin that is never installed until
#   READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS. Sixty minutes to reach a known answer.
#
# The knob and the gate are asserted to move TOGETHER. Two independent switches
# would let a tree exist where the conformance run skips the deployment phase
# while the gate still blocks on it, which is the worst of both.
#
# THE PREDICATE IS NOT THE KNOB. Asserting validate_runs_deployment_phase in
# isolation says nothing about the two places that consult it, and both survive
# being disconnected: `if true` in phase_readiness silently restores the readiness
# gate, and a hardcoded `--phase all` in phase_conformance silently restores the
# phase set. Each call site therefore gets a case that drives the phase function
# itself, with the boundary commands (the deployer, the gate, kubectl, the aicr
# binary) replaced and nothing else.
#
# Hermetic: sources phases.sh, which defines constants and functions only, reads
# run-sim as text, and drives the two phase functions against fixture files under
# a run-scoped scratch directory. No cluster, no aicr binary.
