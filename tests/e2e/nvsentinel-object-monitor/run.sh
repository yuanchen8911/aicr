# nvsentinel-object-monitor mixin: runtime e2e (#2612)
# =============================================================================
#
# Drives the real product path (aicr recipe -> aicr bundle -> the bundle's own
# install.sh) against a live Kind cluster, then asserts that an unhealthy
# operator DaemonSet pod produces both a published health event and a node
# condition, and that the same pod inside the grace period produces neither.
# The CEL unit tests cannot catch a break in chart enablement, policy
# serialization, RBAC wiring, or event delivery.
#
# Only the GPU Operator policy runs live; the network-operator policy differs
# solely in its namespaces, which are asserted against the catalog by
# TestMixinNVSentinelObjectMonitor_PolicyNamespacesMatchCatalog.
#
# BACKDATING CAVEAT (read before touching the unhealthy-pod step):
# kubelet re-syncs status.startTime, so a one-shot patch is overwritten within
# seconds, reopening the grace window and flapping the condition back to
# healthy. Hence the background re-patch loop. The flapping is an artifact of
# impersonating 30 minutes in seconds of wall-clock; in production startTime
# does not move and the condition is stable once it fires.
#
# PREREQUISITES: go, kind, kubectl, helm, yq
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
#   CLUSTER_NAME   Kind cluster name (default: aicr-nvsentinel-object-monitor-e2e).
#                  Always recreated, then deleted at the end unless
#                  KEEP_CLUSTER=true.
#   KEEP_CLUSTER   Skip cluster teardown on exit (default: false).
#   AICR_BIN       Path to a prebuilt aicr binary (default: built fresh).

# independent of slog's attribute order.
#
# `--tail=-1` is required, not cosmetic. `kubectl logs` defaults to the last 10
# lines *whenever a selector is given* and to the whole log otherwise, and
# `--since-time` does not lift that cap -- both filters apply. Without it this

# while reconciling: in run 36418909956, 17 lines landed between the event being
# published and this function reading the log, so the event it was looking for
# had already scrolled out of the window (#2866). The sibling npd script has
# always passed it (`npd-nvsentinel-object-monitor/run.sh`, wait_for_log_line).
#
# The cap silently weakened the negative assertions too: an event that scrolled
# out reads as "no event published", so assert_no_health_event could pass
# without the property holding.
#
# Returns nonzero if the log query fails, rather than calling err: this runs
