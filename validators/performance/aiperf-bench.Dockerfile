# Pre-built AIPerf benchmark image used by the inference-perf performance
# validator. Bakes aiperf at build time so benchmark pods need no PyPI access
# at runtime (air-gap friendly) and every run uses an identical version.
#
# The aiperf pin lives here — bump AIPERF_VERSION and cut a new aicr release
# to roll forward. Consumers pin to a specific aiperf-bench:<semver> tag or
# let :latest track the CLI version via catalog.Load rewriting.
#
# Two-stage build: the `builder` stage carries the full C/C++ toolchain and
# compiles any dependency that lacks a prebuilt wheel for the target platform,
# installing the whole closure into a self-contained virtualenv. The final
# stage copies only that venv, so the toolchain never ships in the runtime
# image (keeps it slim and air-gap friendly). This is deliberately robust to
# source-only wheels: aiperf pulls deps that have no linux/arm64 wheel (e.g.
# crick) and, on Python versions without cp3XX wheels yet, no wheel for
# pyzmq/uvloop either. Compiling those in the builder means the arm64 image
# never regresses regardless of aiperf's dependency set.
#
# The runtime stage is NVIDIA's distroless Python image. It ships no shell,
# no package manager, and no login tooling, so it cannot host `RUN` steps —
# that is exactly why the builder stays on python:3.13-slim. Two consequences
# follow and are handled below:
#   1. `useradd` is unavailable; the base already defines a non-root `nvs`
#      user (uid 1000), which we adopt instead of minting our own.
#   2. `/bin/sh` is absent, so the benchmark Job cannot frame its result JSON
#      with `sh -c 'aiperf ...; echo; cat; echo'`. aiperf_entrypoint.py
#      reproduces that framing with the standard library; buildAIPerfJob in
#      validators/performance/inference_perf_constraint.go invokes it with
#      exec-form argv.

# Single global default so the builder install and the final-stage
# io.aicr.aiperf.version label always move together on a bump; each stage
# redeclares `ARG AIPERF_VERSION` (without a value) to pull it into scope.

# ---- Build stage: toolchain + compile-to-venv (never shipped) ----
# renovate: pinned to 3.13. aiperf 0.11.0 declares requires-python <3.14, so
# pip refuses to install it on 3.14 regardless of this stage's toolchain — the
# 3.14 move is blocked on aiperf upstream supporting 3.14, then a deliberate
# arm64+amd64-validated bump. Tracked in #1910.
