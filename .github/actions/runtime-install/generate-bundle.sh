  # No NVSentinel override: the kind overlay assigns
  # labeler.assumeDriverInstalled itself (#2181). Kind recipes are
  # deliberately host-installed (nvkind: driver.enabled=false, driver
  # preinstalled on the host, no driver pod for the NVSentinel labeler to
  # observe), so the value is required — it is now supplied by the recipe
  # rather than by this caller, and CheckNVSentinelDriverLabelDetectable
  # verifies it.
