# Build Provenance Demo

Every released AICR image carries a signed SLSA Build Provenance v1 attestation
on its multi-platform index, plus a signed CycloneDX SBOM and a signed OpenVEX
document on each platform's own manifest, produced by NVIDIA CI on tag and
recorded in the public Rekor transparency log. Released binaries ship a separate
SPDX SBOM asset (`*.sbom.json`); only the image SBOM uses the signed OCI
attestation flow. This demo walks the consumer-side verification chain: what a
downstream operator runs to confirm an artifact came from NVIDIA, from a known
commit, and contains a known software bill of materials.

The producer side runs in `.github/workflows/on-tag.yaml`; nothing here needs
NVIDIA credentials or repo access. The companion script is
[`provenance-demo.sh`](provenance-demo.sh); the slide deck is
[`provenance-demo-slides.html`](provenance-demo-slides.html).

This walkthrough covers:

1. Resolve the latest release tag to an immutable digest.
2. Verify the SLSA Provenance v1 attestation with `gh attestation verify`.
3. Verify the CycloneDX SBOM and the OpenVEX document with `cosign verify-attestation`.
4. Use the SBOM for vulnerability scanning and license compliance.
5. Audit the signature in the Rekor transparency log.
6. Enforce verification at admission time with Sigstore Policy Controller or Kyverno.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| `curl`, `jq` | Resolve the latest release tag from the GitHub API |
| [`crane`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane) | Resolve mutable tags to immutable digests without pulling layers |
| [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) | Verifies attestations against NVIDIA's identity (`gh attestation verify`) |
| [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) | Verifies SBOM and VEX attestations with an explicit signer policy |
| `grype` *(optional)* | SBOM-based vulnerability scan |
| `rekor-cli` *(optional)* | Transparency-log lookup |

This demo uses `gh` and `cosign`, which manage their own Sigstore trust roots,
so no `aicr trust update` is needed.

## 1. Resolve the latest tag to a digest

A registry tag is mutable — anyone with push rights can move it. A digest is a
content hash, so resolving once and pinning everything else to the digest gives
every check the same anchor.

```shell
TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/NVIDIA/aicr/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')
IMAGE=ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr
DIGEST=$(crane digest "${IMAGE}:${TAG}")
IMAGE_DIGEST="${IMAGE}@${DIGEST}"
echo "$IMAGE_DIGEST"
# ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr@sha256:f0c1...
```

That digest is the multi-platform *index*. Provenance describes the build behind
the whole thing and lives there; the SBOM and the VEX each describe exactly one
root filesystem, so they live on the platform's child manifest. Resolve it from
the pinned index rather than from the tag, because a tag repointed between the
two lookups would pair the SBOM with a different release:

```shell
PLATFORM="linux/$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/')"
DIGEST_PLATFORM=$(crane digest --platform "${PLATFORM}" "${IMAGE_DIGEST}")
IMAGE_PLATFORM="${IMAGE}@${DIGEST_PLATFORM}"
```

The `aicrd` server image is published in lockstep, but its digest is
independent — resolve it separately:

```shell
IMAGE_AICRD=ghcr.io/nvidia/aicrd
DIGEST_AICRD=$(crane digest "${IMAGE_AICRD}:${TAG}")
```

## 2. Verify the image (SLSA Provenance v1)

`gh attestation verify` is the simplest path (run `gh auth login` or set
`GH_TOKEN` first): it fetches the attestation from the GitHub attestations API
by default, validates the Sigstore signature against the Fulcio cert chain and a
Rekor inclusion proof, and enforces that the artifact comes from `--repo`
and was signed by the exact release workflow named in `--signer-workflow`
(pinning `--owner` alone would trust any workflow in any NVIDIA repository).

```shell
gh attestation verify "oci://${IMAGE_DIGEST}" --repo NVIDIA/aicr --signer-workflow NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/attest-images.yaml --source-ref "refs/tags/${TAG}"
```

Expected output:

```text
Loaded digest sha256:f0c1... for oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr@sha256:f0c1...
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
✓ Verification succeeded!

The following policy criteria will be enforced:
  - OIDC Issuer must match: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  - Source Repository URI must match: https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr
  - Build signer workflow must match: NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/attest-images.yaml
  - Predicate type must match: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1
```

Same for `aicrd`:

```shell
gh attestation verify "oci://${IMAGE_AICRD}@${DIGEST_AICRD}" --repo NVIDIA/aicr --signer-workflow NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/attest-images.yaml --source-ref "refs/tags/${TAG}"
```

### Why pin to the digest

A tag-only verify (`oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr:vX.Y.Z`) resolves to whatever
digest the tag points at *now*. If the tag is repointed between resolve and
verify, the two see different artifacts. Always pass `@sha256:...`.

## 3. Verify the CycloneDX SBOM and the OpenVEX document

Different predicates, same trust model. `cosign verify-attestation` enforces an
explicit signer policy (issuer + the release workflow's exact identity at
`${TAG}`; a `refs/tags/.+` regexp would accept any AICR release's signature) and
writes the verified DSSE envelope to disk. Both subjects are the *platform*
manifest; asking the index for either type returns nothing:

```shell
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type cyclonedx \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/attest-images.yaml@refs/tags/${TAG}" \
  "${IMAGE_PLATFORM}" \
  --output-file predicate.json
```

The output file is a DSSE envelope; the inner `predicate` is the CycloneDX SBOM:

```shell
jq -r '.payload' predicate.json | base64 -d | jq '.predicate' > sbom.json
```

The VEX document sits beside it on the same manifest. The SBOM says what is in
the image; the VEX records AICR's triage verdict for each CVE it covers, and
why. Most statements are `not_affected`, but the format also carries `affected`,
`fixed` and `under_investigation`, and any of those is published as curated. They are in different formats on purpose: an OCI referrer descriptor has no
name field, so a second CycloneDX document would be indistinguishable from the
SBOM in a listing without downloading both.

```shell
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type openvex \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/attest-images.yaml@refs/tags/${TAG}" \
  "${IMAGE_PLATFORM}" \
  --output-file vex-predicate.json

jq -r '.payload' vex-predicate.json | base64 -d | jq '.predicate' > openvex.json

# Every statement names one product, bound to the platform manifest digest.
jq '[.statements[].products[]["@id"]] | unique' openvex.json
```

An empty `statements` array is a valid answer, not a failure: it means AICR has
triaged no CVE for this image. Every released image carries a VEX document so
that "no exceptions asserted" stays distinguishable from evidence that never
reached the registry. Most images are in that state, so `ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr`
will usually return an empty list here.

### Alternative: binary SBOM from the release page

Released binaries carry their SBOM as a separate release asset, not an OCI
attestation, and it is **SPDX** rather than CycloneDX. That split is real: the
GoReleaser binary path still emits SPDX while the image path has moved to
CycloneDX. Download it under its own name so it does not overwrite the image
SBOM retrieved above:

```shell
VERSION=${TAG#v}                                 # strip the 'v' prefix
OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/')
gh release download "$TAG" \
  --repo NVIDIA/aicr \
  --pattern "aicr_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.sbom.json" \
  --clobber \
  --output sbom-binary.spdx.json
```

## 4. SBOM use cases

**The commands in this section are for the image SBOM** (`sbom.json`, CycloneDX)
and its matching VEX (`openvex.json`, verified for `IMAGE_PLATFORM`). Do not
point them at `sbom-binary.spdx.json`: the jq filters below read CycloneDX keys
and would return nothing against SPDX, and the VEX describes the image, not the
binary. Against the binary SBOM the equivalent queries read `.packages[]`,
`.licenseDeclared`, `.versionInfo`, and `.creationInfo.created`, and there is no
VEX to pass.

**Vulnerability scan:**

```shell
grype sbom:./sbom.json --vex ./openvex.json
```

Feed the same SBOM to Anchore or Snyk; the format is portable. Passing `--vex`
applies AICR's triage, so a finding already analyzed as unreachable does not
re-surface downstream.

**License compliance:**

```shell
jq -r '.components[]
  | select(.licenses != null)
  | "\(.name) \(.version) \(.licenses[0].license.id // .licenses[0].license.name)"' sbom.json
```

**Dependency search (e.g. checking exposure to a named CVE):**

```shell
jq '.components[] | select(.name | contains("vulnerable-lib"))' sbom.json
```

**Audit trail:**

```shell
jq -r '.metadata.timestamp' sbom.json
```

## 5. Audit via Rekor

Rekor is the public, append-only transparency log of every Sigstore signature
ever made. Searching by content digest finds every attestation made against
that artifact — no NVIDIA contact required.

```shell
rekor-cli search --sha "${DIGEST#sha256:}"
# Found matching entries (listed by UUID):
# 24296fb24b8ad77a...

rekor-cli get --uuid 24296fb24b8ad77a... --format json | jq '.body'
```

The Rekor entry is independently witnessed by third parties, so a removed or
tampered attestation in GHCR doesn't erase the historical record.

For build history, the GitHub Actions run logs are public:

```shell
gh run list --repo NVIDIA/aicr --workflow=on-tag.yaml
gh run view <run-id> --repo NVIDIA/aicr --log
```

## 6. In-cluster verification

Verification at `docker pull` time is opt-in per consumer. To make it a
property of the cluster, enforce it with an admission controller. AICR's
images carry **GitHub Artifact Attestations** (Sigstore *bundles*), so the
policy must verify the Sigstore bundle format:

- **Kyverno** — `type: SigstoreBundle`; see
  [Verifying Sigstore Bundles](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-types/cluster-policy/verify-images/sigstore/#verifying-sigstore-bundles).
  Not yet verified against AICR images — cluster testing returned `no matching
  signatures found`; prefer Policy Controller. See #1537.
- **Sigstore Policy Controller** — requires **v0.13.0+** and
  `signatureFormat: bundle` (see the
  [Sigstore bundle format](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/#sigstore-bundle-format)
  docs); enforcement runs only in namespaces labeled
  `policy.sigstore.dev/include=true`.

Verify against AICR's release identity — issuer
`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, subject
`https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/attest-images.yaml@refs/tags/*`.

> Validated, cluster-tested copy-paste policies are tracked in
> [#1537](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/1537). Earlier inline examples
> here used the legacy Cosign format / a pre-bundle Policy Controller version
> and an out-of-scope negative test, so they were removed rather than ship
> policy that silently fails to verify.

## Troubleshooting

**"sigstore verification failed — trusted root may be stale"** — this demo uses `cosign`/`gh`, which manage their own Sigstore TUF roots; run `cosign initialize` to refresh cosign's (not `aicr trust update`).

**`gh attestation verify` returns "no attestations found"** — the artifact predates
the GitHub-attestation rollout (initially shipped in CI mid-2024) or the digest is
wrong. Verify with `cosign verify-attestation` instead, or confirm the digest with
`crane digest`.

**`cosign verify-attestation` returns "no matching attestations"** — the identity
does not match (check that `${TAG}` is the release the digest was resolved
from), or the attestation lives on a different artifact (the
attestation is anchored to the OCI manifest digest, and multi-arch images have a
manifest list above the per-arch manifest). The SBOM and the VEX are on
`${IMAGE_PLATFORM}`, not on `${IMAGE_DIGEST}`. Try
`cosign tree "${IMAGE_PLATFORM}"` to enumerate what's actually attached.
