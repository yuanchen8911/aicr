// SkipChecks narrows a run to the checks the caller can satisfy, one level
// below the phase selection ValidatePhases already takes.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SKIP LIST AND NOT AN ALLOW LIST. The two differ on what happens
// to a check nobody has considered yet. Under a skip list a newly added check
// RUNS, and a lane that cannot satisfy it goes red until someone decides; under
// an allow list it would be excluded in silence. Only the first shape forces
// the decision, so it is the fail-closed one here even though the general rule
// for a security gate runs the other way.
//
// The recipe stays untouched. A check is skipped for a property of the RUN (a
// lane that deploys a subset of the recipe, or runs on simulated devices) and
// not for a property of the recipe, which every other consumer of that recipe
// still gets in full. Expressing it in the recipe would take the check away
// from them too.
//
// A skipped check is REPORTED as skipped, with the reason below, rather than
// dropped: the CTRF report is what the signed evidence bundle attests to, and a
// check that simply vanishes makes the bundle describe a suite nobody declared.
//
// The two guards in preflightSkipChecks are what keep this from becoming a way
// to turn a red run green.

// skipCheckReason is the message recorded against every check the caller
// withheld. It names the mechanism so an auditor reading the evidence bundle
// can tell a caller-declared skip from a check that skipped itself because the
// recipe made its capability inapplicable (see validators/applicability.go).
const skipCheckReason = "skipped: named in skipChecks, so the caller declared this check out of scope for this run"

// skipCheckReasonCode is the same fact as skipCheckReason in the one channel a
// signed evidence bundle preserves. The default (minimal) redaction policy
// blanks TestResult.Message for every test, so a reason carried only in the
// message reaches the attestation as the empty string: a bundle that records
// WHICH check was withheld but not WHY. The code rides TestResult.Extra under
// the allowlisted `skipReason` key instead, and is listed in
// pkg/evidence/redact's ctrfSkipReasons closed set; adding a code there and
// minting it here is one change, per that package's contract.
//
// It is distinct from the codes validators mint for themselves
// (validators/deployment/nvidia_smi.go) precisely so an auditor can tell a
// caller-declared skip from a check that found its own capability
// inapplicable.
const skipCheckReasonCode = "named-in-skip-checks"

// preflightSkipChecks fails closed on a skip list that would not do what its
// author meant, before the cluster is prepared or any Job is deployed. It
// mirrors preflightDeclaredChecks, and aggregates every problem into one error
// so a list with several defects surfaces them in one pass.
//
// Two defects are rejected:
//
//   - unknown: a name matching no validator in the catalog (a typo, or a check
//     that has since been renamed). Such an entry silences nothing, so the
//     check runs and fails, which is the safe direction but one that sends the
//     reader to debug the check rather than the list.
//   - emptied phase: a skip list that removes every declared check from a phase
//     this run requests. That phase would still report StatusPassed, because
//     the skipped entries keep its test count above zero: a green phase that
//     ran nothing. A caller who wants that outcome should stop requesting the
//     phase, which is a visible choice rather than an emergent one.
//
// A third case is a warning rather than an error: a known name that no
// requested phase declares is inert, not wrong, and erroring on it would make
// one config unusable for a narrower diagnostic run.

// PreflightSkipChecks runs the skip-list guard on its own, loading the catalog
// the same way ValidatePhases does, for a caller that performs cluster work of
// its own BEFORE it reaches ValidatePhases.
//
// The CLI is that caller: with neither --snapshot nor --no-cluster, `aicr
// validate` deploys a snapshot-capture agent before it ever constructs the
// validator, so the guard inside ValidatePhases fires only after a
// ServiceAccount, a Role and a Job exist. The --skip-check help text promises
// the opposite ("Rejected before any validation resource is created"), and
// this is what lets the CLI keep that promise.
//
// It does not replace the ValidatePhases and ValidatePhase calls: an SDK or
// server caller reaches those directly and must stay guarded there. Calling
// both is idempotent, since the guard only reads.
//
// Returns nil immediately when the skip list is empty, so a caller on the

// full PhaseOrder, matching ValidatePhases, so the emptied-phase arm sees the
