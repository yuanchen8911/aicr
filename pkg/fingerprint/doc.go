// Package fingerprint extracts a structured cluster identity from a
// snapshot's collector measurements and compares it against a recipe's
// criteria.
//
// A Fingerprint records the cluster-identity dimensions used to bind
// a snapshot to a recipe — service (eks/gke/aks/oke/kind/lke/bcm),
// accelerator (h100/h200/gb200/b200/a100/l40/l40s/rtx-pro-6000), OS
// (ubuntu/rhel/cos/amazonlinux/talos/ol plus raw VERSION_ID), Kubernetes
// server version, region, total node count, and GPU node count. Each
// dimension records the resolved value plus an optional source string
// identifying which collector signal produced it (e.g.,
// "k8s.node.provider", "gpu.hardware.model").
//
// FromMeasurements builds a Fingerprint from a snapshot's measurement
// slice without taking a dependency on pkg/snapshotter, so the
// snapshotter can hold a *Fingerprint field and the verifier and
// bundler packages can consume the type without pulling collectors.
//
// Fingerprint.Match compares a Fingerprint against a recipe.Criteria
// and returns a structured per-dimension diff with four states:
// matched, mismatched, unknown, or not-inferable. "Unknown" covers
// criteria fields the cluster cannot reveal (intent, platform);
// "not-inferable" covers opt-in-only criteria values that no
// measurement yields (the generic service). The overall
// MatchResult.Matched flag is true so long as no dimension is
// mismatched, leaving the other two states for human review.
//
// This package is the foundation for ADR-007 verifiable recipe test
// evidence. The fingerprint and per-dimension diff are recorded in the
// evidence bundle's predicate body so a maintainer reviewing a
// contribution can confirm the cluster the recipe was tested on
// actually matched the recipe's declared criteria.
