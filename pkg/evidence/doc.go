// Package evidence is an umbrella for AICR's evidence kinds. Per
// ADR-007, AICR ships two kinds of validation evidence, each in its
// own subpackage:
//
//   - cncf — CNCF AI Conformance behavioral evidence (markdown
//     rendering + behavioral collector for submission to the CNCF
//     conformance program).
//   - attestation — recipe-test attestation pipeline (signed in-toto
//     Statement plus supporting bundle).
//   - verifier — offline verification for recipe-evidence bundles
//     produced by `aicr validate --emit-attestation`.
//
// This file exists only to give the umbrella package a package-level
// doc comment. The subpackages contain all the runtime code.
