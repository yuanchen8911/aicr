// Package redact minimizes the sensitive operational detail an evidence
// bundle physically ships, while leaving the cryptographic verification
// story intact.
//
// The signed predicate commits to artifacts by hash and carries the derived
// fingerprint / criteria-match / per-phase counts — that is the conformance
// signal. The snapshot and CTRF payloads are the *backing content* those
// digests point at, not the signal itself, so they can be shrunk without
// weakening the binding.
//
// Two transforms are applied by the minimal policy:
//
//   - Snapshot: a fail-closed allowlist that is enforced at every level —
//     measurement type, subtype, AND data key. Only enumerated types,
//     subtypes, and keys survive; a new type, subtype, or key a future
//     collector adds is dropped until explicitly allowlisted (there is no
//     keep-all subtype). Node names, provider instance IDs, the raw node
//     label/taint set, kernel/sysctl tuning, loaded modules, and systemd
//     service config are dropped.
//   - CTRF: per-test Stdout and Message (free-form log text that can leak IPs,
//     DNS names, secret/cert names, internal URLs) are omitted; the pass/fail
//     signal (name, status, duration, suite, summary counts) is preserved. The
//     structured per-test Extra map is rebuilt against a fail-closed key AND
//     value allowlist (ctrfExtraAllowlist): only enumerated low-cardinality
//     keys survive, and each surviving value must additionally pass its key's
//     validator (non-negative decimal count, or a closed set of known skip
//     codes) — so an identifier smuggled under an allowed key (e.g. an IP in
//     nodesTotal, a hostname or unminted code in skipReason) is dropped, not
//     published. This is
//     the publication boundary: emission-side validation alone is bypassable
//     via raw prefixed stdout. A signed bundle can still distinguish a
//     1-of-2-node pass from 2-of-2 and preserve a skip reason without shipping
//     free-form log text. An Extra map that retains nothing is dropped rather
//     than shipped as an empty object.
//
// Both functions are pure and non-mutating: they build fresh structures and
// never alter their inputs, so the full (unredacted) artifacts remain
// available for the --full emit path and for computing the predicate
// fingerprint from the raw snapshot.
