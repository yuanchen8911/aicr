// Package attestation implements the recipe-test-attestation evidence
// kind defined in ADR-007 (docs/design/007-recipe-evidence.md).
//
// A recipe-test-attestation bundle is a signed, content-addressed
// artifact that ties an AICR recipe to an `aicr validate` run on real
// hardware. The signed payload is an in-toto Statement carrying a
// custom predicate: predicateType
// https://aicr.run/recipe-evidence/v1 for unprofiled recipes, or
// https://aicr.run/recipe-evidence/v2 when the recipe carries a
// metadata.selectedProfile — the v2 predicate adds a profile block
// (selection, advertiser, recipe-scoped policy-descriptor identity;
// ADR-015). The supporting files
// (recipe, snapshot, BOM, CTRF, manifest) ship alongside in an OCI
// artifact for reviewer convenience and offline verification.
//
// Cluster fingerprint and criteria matching are delegated to
// pkg/fingerprint (FromMeasurements + Fingerprint.Match), whose types
// the Predicate uses directly so the on-the-wire schema stays in lock-
// step with what fingerprint.Fingerprint and MatchResult serialize to.
//
// This package only emits; verification lives elsewhere.
