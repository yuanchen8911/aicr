// objectNameKeys are the value keys Helm's chart.fullname and chart.name
// templates read, so they rename objects rather than reconfigure them, which is
// why the identity axis projects these two rather than comparing merged values
// wholesale: a values comparison would report every tuning change as an object
// having moved. A chart can also name an object through a value of its own
// (serviceAccount.name), which this does not see.
//
// The two do not carry the same consequence. fullnameOverride names the
// objects, so moving it is applied as delete-and-recreate. nameOverride feeds
// app.kubernetes.io/name, which the standard chart scaffold puts in
// spec.selector; that is immutable, so moving it while the object's name holds
// fails the upgrade outright.

// ApplyInheritedObjectNames pins each ref's object names back to the ones a
// prior bundle deployed with, so regenerating a recipe on an AICR upgrade does
// not rename the objects a running release owns.
//
// It is a separate entry point from ApplyInheritedIdentity because object
// names are not on the ref: they live in the merged values, which only a
// bundle records by value. prior and current are keyed by component, and a
// component ABSENT from prior is left alone — that is a first deploy, which
// takes the current default like any other.
//
// Only fullnameOverride and nameOverride are carried, never arbitrary values.
// Inheriting general configuration would freeze a component against registry
// updates the operator does want; these two are different because they name
// objects rather than configure them.
//
// A value is written only where it DIFFERS from what the current resolve
// produces, so a steady-state inherit adds nothing to the emitted recipe and
// an override appears exactly where a rename was prevented. An override that
// was newly added by the current values is written as an explicit nil, which
// mergeValues treats as unset: letting it apply would rename the running
// objects just as surely as dropping one.
//
// Every inherited value is validated before anything is written, and one bad
// value rejects the whole artifact rather than being skipped. The values are
// operator-supplied, they land after the current recipe has been validated,
// and deployers interpolate them into generated install scripts — but the
// deciding reason is the same as the namespace path's: a silently ignored pin
// is the rename this exists to prevent.
