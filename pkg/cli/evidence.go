		Name:     "evidence",
		Category: functionalCategoryName,
		Usage:    "Manage recipe evidence bundles: digest, publish, sign, verify.",
		Description: `Operations on recipe-evidence bundles (v1 for unprofiled
recipes, v2 when the recipe carries a configuration profile).

Bundles are produced by ` + "`aicr validate --emit-attestation`" + ` and consumed
by maintainers and CI to verify a recipe contribution without re-running
the validators against hardware they may not have access to. Most
subcommands are offline; ` + "`publish`" + ` reaches the OCI registry and Sigstore.

Subcommands:

  digest   Print the canonical digest of a resolved recipe.
  publish  Sign and push an already-emitted bundle, then write its pointer.
  sign     Sign an already-pushed, unsigned bundle and patch its pointer.
  verify   Verify a bundle's integrity claims.

See docs/design/007-recipe-evidence.md for the trust model.`,
