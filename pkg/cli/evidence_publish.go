		Name:      "publish",
		Category:  functionalCategoryName,
		Usage:     "Sign and push an already-emitted evidence bundle.",
		ArgsUsage: "<bundle-dir>",
		Description: `Sign, push, and write the pointer for a recipe-evidence bundle
(v1 or v2) that was produced earlier by ` + "`aicr validate --emit-attestation`" + `
(without --push), leaving an unsigned bundle on disk.

This decouples the cluster-bound validate step from the
Fulcio/Rekor-bound signing step so they can run on different networks:
validate where the cluster is reachable (often a corporate VPN), then
publish from a host with Sigstore egress (CI runner, jump box, hotspot).

The signed artifact is content-addressable, so the result is identical
to the one-shot ` + "`validate --emit-attestation --push`" + ` output regardless of
which host ran which leg — the predicate (including its baked-in
attestedAt timestamp) is signed verbatim from the bundle on disk.

<bundle-dir> is either the directory ` + "`--emit-attestation`" + ` wrote (holds
summary-bundle/ and receives pointer.yaml) or the summary-bundle/
directory itself.

Keyless OIDC signing uses the same precedence chain as ` + "`aicr validate --push`" + `:
--identity-token > COSIGN_IDENTITY_TOKEN env > GitHub Actions ambient OIDC >
--oidc-device-flow > interactive browser flow.

Example:

  # On VPN: produce an unsigned bundle from a passing validation.
  aicr validate -r recipe.yaml -s snapshot.yaml --emit-attestation ./out

  # Off VPN: sign, push, and write the pointer.
  aicr evidence publish ./out --push ghcr.io/myorg/aicr-evidence`,
