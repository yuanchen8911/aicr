// evidenceSignCmd implements `aicr evidence sign <pointer>`. It completes the
// signing leg for a bundle that was already pushed unsigned (via
// `--no-sign`): it pulls the bundle the committed pointer references, signs
// it with ambient OIDC, attaches the Sigstore Bundle as an OCI referrer, and
// patches the pointer's signer block in place. This is the step the
// fork-based CI workflow runs after a contributor commits an unsigned pointer.
func evidenceSignCmd() *cli.Command {
	return &cli.Command{
		Name:      "sign",
		Category:  functionalCategoryName,
		Usage:     "Sign an already-pushed, unsigned evidence bundle and patch its pointer.",
		ArgsUsage: "<pointer>",
		Description: `Sign the bundle a committed pointer references, then fill in the
pointer's signer block in place.

Consumes the unsigned pointer left by ` + "`aicr evidence publish --no-sign`" + ` (or
` + "`validate --emit-attestation --push --no-sign`" + `): the pointer already carries
` + "`bundle.oci`" + ` + ` + "`bundle.digest`" + `, so no recipe-name or bundle-ref input is
needed. The bundle is pulled (not re-emitted), its predicate signed with
keyless OIDC (Fulcio + Rekor), and the resulting Sigstore Bundle attached
as an OCI referrer of the existing artifact. The pointer's
` + "`signer.{identity,issuer,rekorLogIndex}`" + ` are then written back to the same file.

This is the only leg that needs Fulcio egress, so it is designed to run in
CI (GitHub Actions ambient OIDC) where Sigstore is reachable, while the
push leg runs wherever the cluster lives.

Keyless OIDC signing uses the same precedence chain as ` + "`aicr evidence publish`" + `:
--identity-token > COSIGN_IDENTITY_TOKEN env > GitHub Actions ambient OIDC >
--oidc-device-flow > interactive browser flow.

With --relocate, the now-signed pointer is moved from its flat pending path
(` + "`recipes/evidence/<recipe>.yaml`" + `) to its canonical per-source path
(` + "`recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<source>/<digest>.yaml`" + `) — the layout the
per-source contract gate requires. A flat pointer is the only committable
state for an unsigned pointer, since the ` + "`<source>`" + ` segment derives from the
signer it does not yet have. --relocate is idempotent: an already-signed flat
pointer is moved without re-signing.
