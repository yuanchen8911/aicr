// upgradeCheckCmd creates the "upgrade-check" CLI command.
func upgradeCheckCmd() *cli.Command {
	return &cli.Command{
		Name:     "upgrade-check",
		Category: functionalCategoryName,
		Usage:    "Report whether moving between two recipes or bundles is safe to apply",
		Description: `Compare two artifacts component by component and report a verdict for
each component whose version or identity changed, from the transition records
this aicr release ships. That comparison is the default and it reads no
cluster state: the two artifacts are all it looks at, and nothing is
inspected, deployed or modified. A cm:// path is an artifact location like a
file path, so reading or writing one does contact that cluster's API to fetch
or store the ConfigMap.

Either side may be a recipe file or a bundle directory; a bundle is read
through the recipe.yaml at its root. Omitting --to re-resolves the --from artifact's own
criteria against this binary's registry, which answers "am I behind, and does
catching up hurt?" rather than "is this move safe?".

Two flags do read a cluster. --from cluster takes the source side from what
Helm and Argo CD each recorded they last applied. That answers which version
is installed and answers nothing else: a resource somebody edited by hand
leaves the record untouched, and reading the record will not say so. It is not
a view of live state.

--scan-cluster is an advisory pass for objects an upgrade could disturb that
carry no deployer ownership marker. It warns and never changes the exit code.
--from cluster implies it; pass --scan-cluster=false there to skip it.

Pass the deployed bundle as --from where you have it. Object names
(fullnameOverride, nameOverride) are compared only from a bundle, because a
recipe records its values by reference and a cluster read recovers versions
alone; given either, that comparison is skipped and the report says so above
the table.

Operator steps are deployer-scoped, so --deployer is required whenever any
component carries steps. A cluster read is stricter: it requires --deployer
whatever the records turn out to hold, because a release name encodes the
deployer that wrote it and attribution cannot run without one. It requires
--to as well, a cluster carrying no criteria to re-resolve.

Exits non-zero on any verdict other than safe, unknown included: a
transition nobody assessed is not a transition anyone approved. Records are
still being authored, so most comparisons report unknown today and fail.
The report prints in full either way; pass --fail-on-error=false to report
without failing.

Examples:
  # The deployed bundle against a freshly generated recipe
  aicr upgrade-check --from ./bundles-v0.16.0 --to new-recipe.yaml --deployer argocd

  # Two recipes, when no bundle was kept (object names are not compared)
  aicr upgrade-check --from old-recipe.yaml --to new-recipe.yaml --deployer argocd

  # Two helm bundles
  aicr upgrade-check --from ./bundles-v0.16.0 --to ./bundles-v0.17.0 --deployer helm

  # Am I behind, and does catching up hurt?
  aicr upgrade-check --from ./bundles-v0.16.0 --deployer helm

  # What is actually installed, rather than what an artifact claims
  aicr upgrade-check --from cluster --to new-recipe.yaml --deployer helm

  # JSON for a pipeline, reporting only
  aicr upgrade-check --from old.yaml --to new.yaml --format json --fail-on-error=false`,
