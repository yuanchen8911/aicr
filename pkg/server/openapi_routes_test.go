// REST is one of the four surfaces ROADMAP §1 freezes at v1, and
// api/aicr/v1/server.yaml is its declared contract. Until this file, nothing in
// the tree read that spec for routing purposes: no workflow, no Makefile target,
// and no tool validated it, diffed it, or checked it against the handlers. The
// published contract and the running server were free to drift, and did — #1943
// had to retroactively align the spec with what the handler actually accepted.
//
// These tests close the routing half of that gap (issue #2112). They are
// deliberately derived from the spec rather than from a hand-maintained list:
// TestRouteConfiguration in serve_test.go already pins the six application
// routes by hand, which catches a deleted route but cannot catch a route the
// spec promises and the server never registers.
//
// Scope: paths and methods only. Request and response *shapes* are covered by
// the contract tests in openapi_sync_test.go, and the breaking-change diff gate
// against a committed baseline is the remaining part of #2112 — that baseline
// cannot be captured until #2417 removes the alpha apiVersion enum values, or
// it would fail on its own planned removal.
