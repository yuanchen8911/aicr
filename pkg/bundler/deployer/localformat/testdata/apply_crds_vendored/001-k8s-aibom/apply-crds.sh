# Apply k8s-aibom's CRDs from its pinned chart, ahead of `helm upgrade`.
#
# Helm installs a chart's crds/ directory on first install and never touches it
# again, so a chart bump whose CRDs changed would otherwise leave the previous
# schema in place: the API server then silently prunes the new controller's
# writes to fields the old schema does not know.
#
# AICR emits this script only for components the registry marks ownsCRDs whose
# ref still points at the registry-pinned chart. That flag records an audit of
# one specific chart: that the component solely owns every CRD it ships, and
# ships none using spec.conversion.strategy: Webhook. It says nothing about a
# chart an overriding ref points at.

# names, which is the wrong-cluster write this contract exists to prevent.
