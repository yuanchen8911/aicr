// The Chart.yaml templates spell both keys literally, because a templated key
// reads far worse than the value it labels. The tests that look annotations up
// by these constants are what holds the two in sync: a domain change that
// misses the templates turns every lookup into a miss and fails them.

// chartStamp carries the two versions written into every generated wrapper
// Chart.yaml.
//
// A generated wrapper's single `version:` field was being asked two
// questions at once — "what produced this artifact" and "what is inside
// it" — and answered neither, reporting a hardcoded 0.1.0 for both. ADR-021
// Decision 7 splits them.
//
// AICRVersion answers the first and lands in `version:` plus the
// aicr.run/generated-by annotation. It is Helm-valid by construction:
// deployer.NormalizeChartVersion folds an unstamped "dev" build to
// defaults.DevChartVersion, because Helm refuses to load a chart whose
// version is not SemVer 2.
//
// PayloadVersion answers the second and lands in `appVersion:` plus the
// aicr.run/component-version annotation. It is deliberately NOT normalized:
// Helm treats both of those as free-form strings, so a Kustomize ref such as
// "release-1.4" does not have to masquerade as SemVer to be reported.

// component c's content and was produced by AICR build aicrVersion.
//
// The payload version is the upstream chart version for Helm-typed
// components and the git ref for Kustomize-typed ones. A component with
// neither ships only AICR-authored recipe content — a manifest-only
// component, or an injected -pre / -post / -readiness folder whose parent
// has no upstream pin — so AICR's own version is the honest payload version
// there. That fallback is also why the annotation is emitted
// unconditionally: a consumer reading aicr.run/component-version never has
// to distinguish "absent" from "empty".
