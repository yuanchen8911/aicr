# ==============================================================================
# Kubernetes connection resolution
# ==============================================================================
# Inputs, all optional:
#   KUBE_CONTEXT     context name to act on.
#   KUBECONFIG       path to a kubeconfig. Both helm and kubectl read it from
#                    the environment, so no flag is derived from it.
#   KUBECONFIG_FLAG  deprecated. A literal helm flag string, translated below.
#
# helm and kubectl spell the same connection option differently -- helm's
# --kube-context is kubectl's --context -- so a context resolves to two arrays
# rather than one shared string. Forwarding helm's spelling to kubectl aborts on
# an unknown flag; dropping it silently is worse, because the reads and the
# cluster writes would then land on whatever context the ambient kubeconfig
# names, which is the wrong-cluster write this contract exists to prevent.
#
# An option this contract does not translate is refused rather than guessed at.
#
# Every rejection below exits before the first cluster call. A connection
# option that is merely dropped is indistinguishable from one never set, and
# the fallback is the ambient context.
#
# Both arrays are always declared, but a given script calls only one of the two
# binaries, so the other is legitimately unread here.

# Records the kubeconfig the deprecated flag names. A value disagreeing with an
# existing KUBECONFIG selects a different cluster exactly as two contexts would,
# so it is refused on the same grounds rather than silently overwritten.
#
# Exported as well as passed: bash cannot export an array, and the deprecated
# variable is unset once translated, so a child script re-running this prologue
# would otherwise see no kubeconfig and fall back to the ambient one.
# Records the context the deprecated flag names. Repeats are allowed only while
# they agree: each occurrence used to overwrite the last, so the final value
# won silently and every later helm and kubectl call -- including the CRD
# writes and the taint removal -- acted on it.
