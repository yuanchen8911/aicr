# AI Cluster Runtime Deployment

Recipe Version: v0.1.0
Bundler Version: v1.0.0

Per-component bundle for deploying NVIDIA AI Cluster Runtime components
for GPU-accelerated Kubernetes workloads.

## Configuration



## Components

The following components are included (deployed in order). Each component
lives in a numbered `NNN-<name>/` folder and is installed as a Helm release
via its own `install.sh`:

| Component | Version | Namespace | Source |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| skyhook-customizations | N/A | skyhook | local |




## Quick Start

Run the included deployment script:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

Use `--no-wait` to skip Helm chart-level waiting where AICR uses `--wait` (keeps `--timeout` for hooks):

```bash
./deploy.sh --no-wait
```

> **Note:** The deploy script's final status reflects install/apply results. If `--best-effort` was used, one or more components may still have failed; check warning lines and logs. This does **not** guarantee the cluster is ready to schedule workloads — operator-driven cluster convergence (CRD reconciliation, node tuning, plugin registration, etc.) continues asynchronously after the script exits, in operator-specific ways. See the [AICR CLI Reference](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/docs/user/cli-reference.md#deploy-script-behavior-deploysh) for details.

## Manual Installation

Each component folder contains an `install.sh` that runs `helm upgrade --install`
with the right arguments baked in. To install a single component manually:

```bash
cd NNN-<component-name>
bash install.sh
```

> **Helm 4 vs Helm 3:** On Helm 4 (server-side apply by default), each
> `install.sh` automatically passes `--force-conflicts` so the upgrade can
> overwrite fields that operators (cert-manager, gpu-operator, nvsentinel,
> grove, ...) own on their rotated webhook cert Secrets — without it the
> upgrade fails on field-manager conflicts. On Helm 3 (client-side apply,
> no field-manager conflicts) the flag is omitted; the script detects the
> Helm major version at run time, so the same bundle works with either
> binary.

## Customization

Each component folder has its own `values.yaml` (static) and `cluster-values.yaml`
(dynamic, per-cluster). Edit either before deploying:

```bash
vim NNN-<component-name>/values.yaml
vim NNN-<component-name>/cluster-values.yaml
```

## Upgrade

Re-run the per-component install.sh to upgrade an already-installed release:

```bash
cd NNN-<component-name>
bash install.sh
```

> **CRDs on upgrade.** Helm installs a chart's `crds/` directory on first
> install and never touches it again, so a chart bump whose CRDs changed would
> otherwise run the new controller against the old schema. Folders that also
> contain an `apply-crds.sh` have `install.sh` run it first. It pulls the
> pinned chart once, reads the CRDs out of that archive, and server-side
> applies each one under `--field-manager=helm`, so a field the new chart
> removes actually disappears; a plain server-side apply under the default
> `kubectl` manager would leave fields Helm still owns in place. Only
> components audited as the sole owner of every CRD they ship get this, and
> only while the ref matches the registry's pinned source, chart, and version.
> Those folders need `kubectl` and `timeout` (GNU coreutils) on `$PATH` in
> addition to `helm`; the script refuses to run rather than run unbounded
> inside a deploy, so on macOS install coreutils or apply the CRDs by hand.
> Every helm and kubectl call it makes is bounded, 30s by default and
> overridable with `AICR_CRD_STEP_TIMEOUT`. The bound is per call and
> `deploy.sh` retries a failing component, so the budget it consumes is a
> multiple of that. This step reads the same connection environment as
> `deploy.sh` (`KUBE_CONTEXT`, `KUBECONFIG`, and the deprecated
> `KUBECONFIG_FLAG`) and renders `kubectl`'s own spelling of it. Only
> `--kube-context` and `--kubeconfig` are translated; any other helm connection
> flag stops the step rather than apply CRDs to an unintended cluster. The error
> names the option only, never its argument, so a flag carrying a credential
> does not reach the log. The step is
> skipped when `DRY_RUN_FLAG` is set, and when
> neither the release nor any of the chart's CRDs exist yet, since only then
> does `helm install` create them. A release that was uninstalled leaves its
> CRDs behind, so a reinstall still applies them. Only components audited as
> the sole owner of every CRD they ship get the script; for the rest, applying
> CRDs under Helm's field manager is unsafe because another component's
> release ships the same CRD with a different schema.

## Uninstall

Bundles do not ship an `undeploy.sh`. Uninstall releases in reverse
deployment order using `helm uninstall` directly — one command per
`NNN-<release>/` folder the deploy script installs, including any
injected `*-pre` / `*-post` auxiliaries:

```bash
helm uninstall skyhook-customizations -n skyhook
```

CRDs installed by these charts are intentionally not deleted by Helm; remove
them only when you are sure no other release depends on them. See the
[deployer-native uninstall walkthrough](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/docs/user/cli-reference.md#bundle-uninstall) in the AICR CLI reference for details on
PVC handling, namespace teardown, and the equivalent paths for ArgoCD and
ArgoCD+Helm bundles.

## Troubleshooting

### Check deployment status

```bash
kubectl get pods -A | grep -E 'skyhook-customizations'
```

### View component logs

Inspect a single component's pods (replace `<component>` and `<namespace>`
with one of the entries from the table above):

```bash
kubectl logs -n <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<component>
```
