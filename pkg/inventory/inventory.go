// component's name matched only loosely and that could not then be read. It
// may be a foreign workload drawn in by a shared token, or a real component
// whose storage is damaged, and this package cannot tell which. Summing them
// would merge "we know nothing about this" with "we could not read this".
//
// Neither counts the ordinary case of a record that names something perfectly
// well and matches no component. Those are the overwhelming majority of a real
// cluster and are dropped uncounted by design: reporting them would be a tally
// of everything else installed anywhere, which is noise rather than a finding.
//
// Records is the denominator the two are read against: every object the
// reader examined, in-scope or not. Its unit differs per reader — Helm storage
// records, of which one release contributes one per retained revision, against
// Argo Applications, of which a component has one — so the two are never
// summed.
