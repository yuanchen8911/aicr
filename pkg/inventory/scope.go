// The governing rule is that a record which cannot affect the comparison
// cannot fail it either. Scope decides that, and it is decided before any
// validation rather than after, so an out-of-scope record costs nothing and is

// covers reports how sure this scope is that a record belongs to a component

//
// A component's name is not always the name the cluster stores it under. Only
// the helm and helmfile deployers install under the component's own name;
// helm-controller composes a Flux release as "<targetNamespace>-<name>", so
// gpu-operator is stored as gpu-operator-gpu-operator, and Argo CD prepends a
// user-settable namePrefix to every child Application. The bundle writer's own
// injected folders append a phase. The confident tier is built for the deployer
// being read (see deployerScope), but the possible tier cannot be: a namePrefix
// is the user's, and a namespace may be one the caller did not name.
//
// So the match is loose, and the tier says how loose. A name this project
// itself would have written under the deployer is confident. A name some deployer's naming could
// have produced from a component name is possible, under two anchored rules:
//
//   - a token run, where the component's hyphen-separated tokens appear
//     contiguously in the record's, which catches gpu-operator-gpu-operator
//     and tenant-a-gpu-operator; and
//   - a raw suffix, where the record name simply ends with the component name,
//     which catches tenantgpu-operator from a namePrefix that does not end in
//     a separator, a shape the token rule cannot see because the prefix fuses
//     with the component's first token.
//
// Both rules are anchored deliberately. Bare strings.Contains would be looser
// than either and much harder to reason about: eight registry components are a
// single token, so it would draw in arbitrary unrelated records on a
// coincidental substring.
//
// Looseness is safe here only because strictness follows the tier. A possible
// record that cannot be read is skipped and counted rather than fatal, so
// widening this predicate cannot make a run fail. What it can do is draw in a
// foreign record that reads perfectly well: the raw suffix rule anchors at the
// end of the string rather than at a token boundary, so an unrelated workload
// whose name happens to end in a component's is reported as installed, and
// only the comparison can tell. That is the cost, and it is the survivable
// one. Under-matching has no such safety valve: a component whose record is
// never seen reports as newly installed.
//
// Deciding which component a record actually belongs to is the comparison's
// job, not this one's. It has the recipe and the deployer; this has neither.
