// VerifyCatalog is its counterpart.
//
// As with VerifyCatalog, the digest is computed over THIS Client's
// DataProvider, so what gets signed is the catalog the Client resolves with.
//
// # Signing modes are constrained to what VerifyCatalog can verify
//
// VerifyCatalog verifies against the public-good Sigstore root, requires a
// transparency-log entry, and pins the certificate to the GitHub Actions OIDC
// issuer. It exposes no key, no trust-root, and no offline option, because the
// recipe catalog is a release artifact NVIDIA signs — not something a consumer
// re-signs privately.
//
// SignCatalog therefore REJECTS the four OIDCResolve settings that would
// produce a signature its own counterpart could not check:
//
//   - SigningKey — a key-signed catalog has no verification path at all.
//   - FulcioURL — a certificate from a private CA does not chain to the
//     public-good root.
//   - RekorURL — an entry in a private transparency log cannot be verified
//     against the public-good root either. The flag can name a public-good v1
//     URL as well, which would verify, but the two are indistinguishable from
//     the URL alone, so this fails closed.
//   - DisableTLogUpload — verification requires a transparency-log entry.
//
// Each is rejected with ErrCodeInvalidRequest before any signing work runs, so
// the failure is immediate and explains itself rather than surfacing later as
// an unverifiable artifact.
//
// This is a guard, not a decision procedure, and the residual gap is worth
// stating: SigningConfigPath passes through because the release path requires
// it, and a signing config can itself name a private Fulcio or Rekor. Every
// rejected setting above exists ONLY to depart from the public-good defaults,
// which is what makes rejecting them unambiguous; a signing config does not.
//
// If private catalog signing is ever needed, both halves have to move
// together — widening this without widening VerifyCatalog is what this guard
// exists to prevent.
//
// A signature that yields no bundle is treated as a failure rather than a
// silent success: it means the attester could not obtain an OIDC token.
