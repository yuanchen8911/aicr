//
// A Kustomize component pins Tag where a Helm one pins Version, and records
// apply to both (pinnedVersionFor checks a record's ceiling against whichever
// the registry declares). Reading Version alone would compare "" to "" for

// recipe is regenerated from scratch on every AICR upgrade. A moved registry
// default relocates or replaces the install, and Helm cannot move a release
// between namespaces, so applying the new recipe installs a second copy beside
// the running one. A version-only projection reports that as no change at all.

// read from the resolved recipe behind it when there is one.

// in the merged values rather than on the ref, and they name the objects the
// chart owns. Dropping a component's fullnameOverride renames every one of
// them, which Helm applies as delete-and-recreate. objectNames supplies the
// table, or nil where the artifacts could not state it.
