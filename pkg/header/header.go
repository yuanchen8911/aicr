// AICR artifact API versioning. These constants are the single source of
// truth for every AICR artifact group/version. Package-local emitters and
// readers select a version by wire kind and schema track; see ADR-022.
//
// Three tracks exist. StableGroupVersion, AuthoringGroupVersion, and
// ProfileGroupVersion name the value each track emits; since the v0.22 emitter
// switch (#2416) each equals its target, GroupVersionV1, GroupVersionV1Beta1
// and GroupVersionV1Beta2 respectively.
//
// The three carried one shared string before the v0.22 emitter switch, which is
// what let a package alias that string directly and still look correct while
// emitting the wrong value later. Alias the constant for your track, never the
// string it happens to equal; the tracks hold distinct values now and a
// collapsed alias shows up as a wrong value rather than a latent one.
//
// Evolution policy (see docs/design/011-artifact-apiversion-policy.md and
// docs/design/022-artifact-maturity-and-deprecation.md): schema changes within
// a version must be additive-only; a breaking change requires a new version
// segment. Alpha versions owe no deprecation window. Beta versions remain
// readable for two AICR releases after deprecation, and GA versions remain
// readable through the current AICR major version. Version bumps that owe a
// window stage readers before emitters.

// AnnotationComponentVersion when it is present, otherwise use the release's
