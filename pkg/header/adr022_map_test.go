// literals. A row that disagrees with the map is a contract bug.
//
// The emitter constants live in five packages. Nothing previously tied them
// to the gate that must accept them or to the target they are headed for, so
// "did we get every emitter?" was answerable only by grep. That is the
// question the ADR-022 §3 emitter switch turns on, and this table answers it.

// adr022Map mirrors the ADR-022 §2 per-kind maturity map. Every AICR wire kind
// with an emitter has a row; §7 requires a new kind to add one in the same
// change that introduces it. A kind emitted through more than one constant
// gets a row per constant, or an edit to the unbound one passes unnoticed.
//
// Scope: this file pins the *constant* contract — that each track constant
// routes to the right gate and target. It does not verify that an individual
// emit site selected the right constant. A catalog emitter that referenced
// RecipeResultAPIVersion instead of RecipeMetadataAPIVersion is invisible here,
// because the stable and authoring constants carried the same string until the
// emitter switch. That half lives in adr022_emit_test.go, which asserts the
// observed apiVersion on a real artifact against its track's constant.
//
// ComponentUpgrades (ADR-021) has a §2 row but no emitter yet, so it has no
// row here. It starts at header.GroupVersionV1Beta1, which
// IsSupportedAuthoringAPIVersion already accepts; add a row with its constant
// when its loader lands.
