// Package upgrade implements ADR-021 component upgrade transition records.
//
// A record answers "is this component version transition safe?" as
// machine-readable data: recipes/components/<component>/upgrades.yaml,
// referenced from registry.yaml via upgrades.file, holding semver-range-keyed
// transitions with a verdict, operator steps grouped by deployer, and the
// evidence backing a safe claim.
//
// # Loading versus validating
//
// Load answers "can I read this?" — decode, the apiVersion and kind gate, and
// the verdict-independent required fields. It fails closed: an unreadable or
// unrecognized record returns ErrCodeInvalidRequest naming what was found and
// what was expected. It is never skipped and never degraded to the unknown
// verdict, because "a record exists and I could not read it" is not "no record
// exists", and collapsing the two hides which action closes the gap.
//
// Set.Validate answers "is this well-formed?" — the pin-relative,
// verdict-dependent, and cross-record rules. It aggregates every violation
// rather than returning the first, so an author sees all of a record's problems
// in one run. The lint gate calls both.
//
// # The nine rules
//
// Rule 1 is Load's; rules 2 through 9 are Validate's, one function each in
// wellformed.go. A reader told there are nine rules otherwise finds eight,
// numbered 2 to 9, because rule 1 is named nowhere in the package.
//
//	1  apiVersion and kind are recognized                        decodeRecord
//	2  to is bounded, its ceiling at or below the pin            checkPinCeiling
//	3  the from domains have no hole up to the pin               checkCoverage
//	4  safe names its verifiedBy                                 checkVerdictFields
//	5  manual and blocked carry steps in every group             checkVerdictFields
//	6  deployer groups partition the deployers                   checkStepGroups
//	7  from is forward-only against to                           checkDirectional
//	8  no two transitions share a to floor for the same from     checkDistinctBoundaries
//	9  hooks name a phase and a local manifests/migrations file  checkHooks
//
// # Matching
//
// MatchIdentities answers "does this move need attention?" over two
// component-to-identity tables, and is pure: no filesystem, no cluster, no
// registry. Match is the same question for a caller holding versions alone.
//
// An identity moves on two axes. Only the version axis is assessed by anybody,
// because that is what a record describes. A move of namespace, chart, source,
// kustomize path, deployment type, manifest file set, pre-manifest file set or
// object name is invisible to a version comparison yet relocates, replaces or
// renames running objects. Helm cannot move a release between namespaces, and
// it applies a rename as delete-and-recreate, or refuses it outright where an
// object keeps its name while its selector labels change, because
// spec.selector is immutable. So a component that moved on the identity axis
// alone gets a ChangeIdentity row that a version comparison would not report
// at all, a component that moved on both gets one row carrying both, and a
// safe verdict is withdrawn to unknown wherever the identity moved. The record
// vouched for a version hop and was never asked about the rest.
//
// The identity fields do not all read an empty value the same way, which is
// the one thing to hold onto here. An absent scalar field is a fact the
// artifact did not record, so it is not compared. An empty manifest set and an
// absent object name are facts it did record — a chart with no
// fullnameOverride names its objects after itself — so dropping one is a move,
// and reporting it is the point.
//
// On the version axis, a record is *crossed* when the source sits below the
// floor its `to` names and the target reaches it. Crossing is a property of the
// jump alone; `from` is not consulted, because a record whose `from` excludes
// the source still describes a boundary the jump flies over, and skipping it
// there is how a recorded block goes unreported. `from` answers the separate
// question of whether that record's guidance was authored for this starting
// point.
//
// Verdict selection runs in this order:
//
//	1  nothing crossed                              unknown
//	2  one crossed, from covers the source          that record's verdict
//	2a   ... but the target is past its to ceiling  blocked, stop at that ceiling
//	3  another crossed record authored blocked      blocked, stop at its to
//	4  two or more crossed                          blocked, stop at the lowest
//	5  one crossed, from does not cover the source  blocked, stop at its to
//
// Rule 2 is the only one that attaches a Transition, and it attaches one for
// every verdict including blocked: that record describes this exact move, so
// its blocked verdict means "not in one step" and its steps say what to do
// instead. Rules 2a, 3, 4 and 5 leave Transition nil, so no renderer can print
// one record's steps for a jump that record does not describe. Rule 2a is the
// forward-reach case: the record was authored for this starting point but stops
// assessing before the target, and lending its verdict there would vouch for
// releases its author cannot have read the migration notes for, which is the
// same reach checkPinCeiling rejects at authoring time. Rule 5 is the
// outside-every-recorded-origin case, usually below the lowest `from` floor:
// nothing describes an upgrade from where the operator is, and an opt-in check
// errs toward safety there. Every blocked version transition names a StoppedAt,
// and every result carries a Reason code and an Explanation sentence saying
// which rule it was and what to do about it.
//
// Matching takes an already validated Set and does not re-run Validate.
// Validate is therefore not optional: a record that violates a well-formedness
// rule still applies and still lends its verdict. A safe record missing its
// verifiedBy (rule 4) is the case that matters, because it reports safe and
// passes a strict run, which is exactly the false confidence a wrong safe
// buys. Only two malformed shapes are inert here, and only because they leave
// nothing to compare against: ranges that do not parse, and a to naming no
// floor. Callers that did not build the Set through Load plus Validate own
// that gap.
//
// # Reporting
//
// NewReport projects match results into the shape a reader and a CI consumer
// both see: one row per changed component, each semver distance already
// rendered as a phrase, and every step list narrowed to the one deployer named.
// It is a projection rather than an alias because a result points into the Set,
// and a report has to outlive it. WriteTable renders that report; a blocked row
// computed from several records, or from none naming the operator's starting
// point, renders no steps, so its detail block is the Explanation alone.
//
// A report built from a cluster read carries a Source block, which WriteTable
// renders above the rows. A read that recognizes nothing is reported rather
// than failed, so every row under it reads "added"; the block is what
// separates that from a kubeconfig on the wrong context, and it is useless
// below the table a reader has already drawn a conclusion from. The two
// readers are accounted for in separate types whose counts are in different
// units and must never be summed.
//
// An identity row held its version, so its FROM and TO columns carry the fields
// that moved rather than the version printed twice, which is the one rendering
// that would read as nothing having happened. A row that moved on both axes
// keeps its versions in those columns and names the move in its notes, and in
// its detail block where it has one: the steps there were authored for a
// version boundary and neither perform the move nor account for it.
//
// A caller that could not read an axis says so on the Report rather than on
// every row, because an unread axis is one fact about the run and not one fact
// per component. ObjectNamesCompared is that flag, and it is stated rather
// than inferred: every versions-only caller leaves it false, which is the
// reading that claims nothing.
//
// Below the rows, the at-risk section reports objects of the kinds the crossed
// records name that carry no deployer ownership marker. It is the one section
// with no omitempty and no skip: a run that scanned nothing says so, because an
// absent warning reads as an all-clear over resources AICR cannot restore. It
// is advisory throughout, scoped to what the rows actually crossed, and reaches
// neither Summary nor FailsRun; a relocation contributes nothing to it, having
// crossed no boundary at all.
//
// The deployer is not inferred. ADR-021 Decision 5 would take it from a `to`
// bundle, which does record it in bundle-info.yaml, but the check reads that
// file only to locate release values and does not take the deployer from it
// yet, so RequiresDeployer reports when a caller has to supply one. It is true for a
// manual row, and for a blocked row that carries a record; the step-less
// blocked rows do not make it true, because a deployer would name a scope
// nothing renders.
//
// # Bundle guidance
//
// A bundle knows the versions it pins and not the ones a cluster runs, so it
// cannot use Match. BundleNotes instead selects every manual or blocked
// transition whose `to` contains a pin, and WriteGuide, WriteNotice and
// NoteLines render them as guidance conditional on each record's `from`, for
// the one deployer the bundle was built with. Nothing is selected for a safe
// transition, so a bundle whose pins cross only safe boundaries carries none.
//
// # Read-only contract
//
// A Set and everything reachable from it must not be mutated. Consumers share
// the same pointers, and nothing re-runs Validate afterwards.
