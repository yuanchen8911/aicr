// Package uatbroker resolves the UAT reservation registry
// (infra/uat/reservations.yaml) and expands the nightly version-matrix
// schedule for the day/night UAT broker (#1274).
//
// The registry maps a human-facing reservation NAME — the key the broker
// leases through the GitHub Actions concurrency group "uat-<name>" so
// contending runs queue rather than race — to the cloud, capacity
// reservation id, accelerator, and the on-disk cluster/test configuration a
// UAT run consumes. LoadRegistryFile + Lookup back the `uat-broker
// reservations` CLI; new infrastructure is onboarded by adding a row, with
// no code change.
//
// ExpandSchedule builds the ordered nightly run list: the tip-of-main cell
// first, then the previous N stable releases in descending semver order, per
// reservation. Cells are ordered newest-first so the nightly controller
// drops the OLDEST releases first when its time-box closes — it simply stops
// at the cursor. Release cells carry their tag in AICRVersion for DC5's
// version-parameterized install; until DC5 lands they install from source.
// Each cell also carries the nightly intents ELIGIBLE at its version: the
// main cell runs every listed intent, while a release cell skips any intent
// whose harness-compat floor (tests/uat/compat.yaml, parsed by ParseCompat)
// is newer than the tag, and records the skip in Cell.Skipped. Release cells
// run a released binary against main's tests/uat/** fixtures and harness, so
// a floor declares the oldest release those fixtures still accept.
//
// CheckFloors rejects over-high floors, which would silently skip a release
// that passes. Its git evidence (which tags contain the commit that set each
// floor) is computed by the calling workflow and handed in as data.
//
// The package performs no network or git I/O and holds no credentials: the
// CLI feeds it the registry and compat files, the raw `git tag` list, and
// the per-floor tag-containment results.
